A Condition is a brief, temporary affliction gained in combat that stacks up over time but is quickly cleared. For example, a creature can have multiple instances of Hobbled, but clears one at the end of each of their turns.

All Conditions will have a numeric value listed when they are inflicted. This represents how many instances of the Condition that creature gains, sometimes called 'stacks'.
