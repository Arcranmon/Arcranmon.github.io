Combat in Shattered Spirits is split up into Rounds, Phases, and Turns. A Round is a complete cycle of combat, where each Phase is completed. A Phase is a collection of Turns that are all occuring at a similar speed in combat. A Turn is a specific character's opportunity to act in combat, where they can use various Techniques to influence the battle.

A Round is divided into the following phases:
**Plotting Phase:** In the Plotting Phase, both the Game Master and the Players will all determine what Techniques they are making use of in the round. No Techniques resolve during the Plotting Phase; it exists simply for players and the Game Master to decide their Techniques for the round. Unlike the other Phases, players and enemies go simultaneously in this Phase. This Phase ends when all players and enemies have decided their Techniques for the Round.
**Instinctive Phase:** The Instinctive Phase is for Techniques that are nearly as fast as the speed of thought. It is the first Phase where Techniques may be resolved, but typically Techniques in this Phase do not provide Movement, and do not target other creatures in a meaningful way.
**Refresh Phase:** This Phase occurs right before the start of a round. Many Stances and Techniques use the Refresh Phase to either grant a creature resources, or as an approximation for the start of a round.
**Phase 1-6:** These numbered Phases are where the bulk of Techniques will be resolved. Phases are resolved in order, 1-6, with Phase 1 representing the fastest Techniques and Phase 6 representing the slowest.
**Resolution Phase:** The final Phase, this represents the end of a Round and is commonly referenced by Techniques.

An individual Phase is divided into Turns, where Players and enemies make use of different Techniques. Within a Phase, players and enemies will alternate who acts, with the next Phase beginning with the faction opposite of that which acted last in the current Phase. Within a Phase players and enemies decide among themselves who goes when. Typically, players get to act first in the first Instinctive Phase of combat; after that, the first to act in the next Phase is always the opposite of whatever group finished the current Phase. For example, if a player acts last in Phase 2, an enemy gets to act first in Phase 3.

The Plotting Phase is where a great deal of the decision making in combat will occur. A Player has 3 Action Points or AP that they can divide among Techniques as they wish. Players will choose the Techniques they wish to use in the Round, then decide which Speed they wish to play them at. In almost every case this is the listed Speed of the Technique, although some Stances and Styles permit changes to the Speed of Techniques. The exception are Techniques with the Set-Up or Follow-Up Speed; rather than being played in a specific Phase, they are attached to another Technique that lacks the Set-Up or Follow-Up Speed. These Techniques are resolved simultaneously with the Technique it is attached to. A Set-Up happens immediately before the Technique, while Follow-Up happens immediately after.

After a Technique is selected during the Plotting Phase a character is committing to using that Technique. However, if a character finds they no longer wish to use a Technique selected in the Plotting Phase, they may choose to either skip that Technique or pay 2 Momentum to replace it with a Technique with the same AP cost and a Speed that is less than or equal to the replaced Technique.
