Heavy Armor tends to heavily feature metal, either in the form of chainmail or plates. Heavy Armor provides the greatest protection, but at the expense of mobility, particularly a character's ability to _Jump_. In exchange, characters have the greatest possible _Guard_ values and receive access to powerful _Ward_ Reactions that allow them to easily ignore low-damage Attacks.
