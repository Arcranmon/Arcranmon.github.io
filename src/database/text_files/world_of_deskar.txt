### Welcome to the world of Deskar, the land of Shattered Spirits!

For as long as any can remember, humanity and spirits have been as one. They have thrived for generations, forging bonds and conquering obstacles with their shared strength. When the spirits bonded to humanity were not sufficient the ancient primal spirits of the world would assist, pushing aside all obstacles. That is, until the Sundering.
&nbsp;
25 years ago something or someone very nearly killed the Great Spirit. While She survived, Her essence was sundered into many parts. Just as She was split, so was every spirit across the land, from the minor spirits bound to humanity to the primal spirits in the deep corners of the world. Spirits that had pacts with local tribes flew into a rage, and disasters wracked the world as the full wrath of the spirits was turned against humanity for the first time. While humanity survived they were scattered and weak, surviving only because they maintained their bonds with lesser spirits.
&nbsp;
Prior to the Sundering, spirits were not constrained to a single element and neither were the humans bound to them. Now, spirits possess a fraction of their former strength and can manipulate only a single element. A farmer who could once control water for irrigation, plow their fields with earth and encourage growth for their crops all with a singular spirit is now lucky to have retained a single aspect of this. With the power of spirits shattered across people, communities began to grow more and more swiftly and, with a more narrow set of powers, humanity began to specialize into more and more specific abilities. The dangers of primal spirits still enraged by the Sundering and the division of power between people forced small hamlets to combine and become towns and cities, relying more on one another more than spirits around them.
&nbsp;
Now, the world stands on a precipice. The primal spirits of the world are injured, enraged, and far fewer in number than they once were. Some within these new towns and cities would strike them down to ensure their safety and guarantee they are never at the mercy of a spirt again. Others, who remember the old tales, seek to calm the spirits, restore She Of Many Parts, and see if they can heal the world. Regardless of their choice, both parties fear the rumors of new, great beasts who are neither spirit nor human, but surpass either in power and cruelty.
&nbsp;
You, and the spirit bound to you, possess great skill and can push this pendulum in either direction. Will you clear a path for humanity in this world and eradicate the threat of the rampaging spirits once and for all, or will you look for a path towards healing and peace, restoring the bond with spirits?
