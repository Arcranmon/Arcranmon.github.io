### Welcome to the world of Deskar, the land of Shattered Spirits!

For as long as any can remember, humanity and spirits have been as one. They have thrived for generations, forging bonds and conquering obstacles with their shared strength. While the world is harsh, full of terrible beasts and primal spirits that rampage across the lands, humanity has been able to carve out small existences, surviving in the liminal spaces between the realms of greater spirits.

However, these fragile spaces are under threat. Great spirits, long dormant within their mountains and seas, are stirring once more. Great lights are seen in the night and plumes of smoke in the day, emanating from the ruins of the Old World. Terrible beasts grow ever more bold, roaming closer and closer to the towns and villages. Most concerning, children who complete their Binding awake screaming, with no idea of the cause of their terror.

You are a Spiritbound of rare skill. While all in this world are bound to a spirit, your talent and your spirit's prowess set you apart. You and your spirit companion are perhaps all that stands between your town and the ruin that may soon approach it. Will you venture forth, rending the land itself to defend yourselves from the rising threat? Or will you seek out the cause of this change and attempt to stop this danger?
