### Earth Spirits
Those that are Bonded to an Earth Spirit draw upon the power of the earth and stone, shaping the terrain around them and making both their will and stance as sturdy as the earth itself. With their connection to the earth, Earthbonded can amplify both their physical strength spirit many times over, wielding weapons that would be impossible for a normal Bonded to even lift much less make use of. The Earth strengthens their spirits to a similar degree, and Earthbonded have earned a reputation as either the most courageous or most reckless of warriors, depending on who you ask. Finally, Earthbonded are valued extremely highly as scouts, as they can 'see' through the earth itself, allowing them to track enemies across vast distances or see even in impossible visibility.

Spirits of Earth tend to take the form of animals known for their strength and endurance, although many lesser Earth Spirits take the form of small burrowing animals such as moles. Regardless, it's rare for an Earth Spirit to ever fully leave the ground; typically, just the head is visible above the ground, with the body remaining hidden underground. Earth Spirits are typically stubborn and slow to change like the earth itself, but are a reliable companion for any Bonded.
