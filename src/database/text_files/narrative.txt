### Narrative Resources

In narrative play characters must manage their Effort and Spirit gauges. The Effort gauge represents a character's ability to push themselves, while the Spirit gauge represents the same for a character's Spirit.

If a character's Spirit gauge is ever full they may no longer use Spirit abilities of any kind while their Spirit reconstitutes itself and recovers. Once there is space on the Spirit gauge a character may use their spirit again as normal.

### Resolving Conflicts

Narrative play in Shattered Spirits is typically fast-paced and requires few dice rolls; a character's Archetype and Talents provides fairly strict guidance on what a character is capable of and, when the stakes and consequences of failure are low, characters should be able to simply succeed at such tasks, especially if they have other enabling factors such as appropriate equipment or the aid of an ally.

&nbsp;

However, when the stakes are high, other factors are attempting to limit a character's chance of success, or the outcome is unclear characters must make a Skill Challenge using their Stakes Sheet.

&nbsp;

[insert Schema stakes sheet here]

&nbsp;

First, based on how your action was described, the GM will determine if it is Bold or Cautious. If it is ambiguous, the player attempting the check may decide which of the two options to pursue. Occasionally, due to Talents are Archetypes, a character may instead roll Skillfully. In this case, they always roll Skillfully.

&nbsp;

After that, your GM will set out Stakes for the roll. There should always be an automatic stake, typically providing some minimal amount of progress towards your roll. Your GM will lay out additional Stakes by deciding on the Dangers for this check, and add markers to the appropriate options on your Stakes Sheet. Additionally, your GM may highlight some Augments that are particularly relevant to the current scene. At this point, a character may take 1 Stress to swap from Bold to Cautious, or vice versa. Additionally, if characters have abilities that allow them to modify the Stakes sheet, they may use them here.

&nbsp;

Players automatically roll 3 dice for this check, but may gain additional ones based on a variety of factors:
* If a character has appropriate gear for the situation, they gain an additional die.
* If a character has talent or magic appropriate for the current situation, they gain an additional die, or two if appropriate.
* If a character has a condition that would hinder their ability to succeed, they may lose a die.
* If a character has done work to prepare for a situation or has set up some other advantage, they may gain a die.

&nbsp;

After determining the character's die pool, characters roll their d6s. A result of 1-2 is a &#8863;, a result of 3-4 is a &#9634;, and a result of 5-6 is a &#8862;. If acting Cautiously, characters reroll &#9634; and &#8862;, while if they are rolling Boldly they reroll &#8863; and &#9634;. If a character is rolling Skillfully, they may reroll dice of their choice. If a character does not wish to reroll, they may take 1 Stress to not reroll phase.

&nbsp;

After completing rolls, characters assign their available dice to Augments and Dangers. The GM then narrates the scene, and applies appropriate consequences and conditions.
