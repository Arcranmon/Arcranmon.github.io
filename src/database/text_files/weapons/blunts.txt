This class of weapons makes use of their weight to deal devastating damage. Comprised largely of axes and hammers, these weapons excel at dealing with armor and are difficult to block. While they have slightly lower accuracy, a Graze with these weapons is comparable to a Hit with another and is more than sufficient to deal with most foes. These weapons tear away at a foe's defenses, leaving them open to future strikes.
