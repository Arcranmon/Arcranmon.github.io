While not a conventional weapon, shields are mechanically a weapon and, in the hands of a skilled user, a deadly bashing tool. While they do little damage, shields provide access to powerful _Block_ Reactions that can only be used while they are being _Wielded_. Additionally, with their ability to inflict potent _Status_ effects even with a low roll, shields are an excellent defensive weapon.
