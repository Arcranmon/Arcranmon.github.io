A class of weapons defined by their reach and high accuracy, lance weapons are excellent for harrying foes and creating areas that are difficult for foes to advance into. Lances are difficult to _Evade_ due to their consistent damage, but can easily be _Blocked_ to significantly reduce the damage dealt. Characters that wish to control the battlefield while dealing consistent damage should pursue a Lance.
