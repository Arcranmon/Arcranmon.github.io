A class of weapons defined by their reach, lance weapons are excellent for harrying foes and creating areas that are difficult for foes to advance into. With their ability to limit mobility and strike at range a skilled wielder of a lance can easily seal off an area of the battlefield, making it difficult for all but the most persistent of foes to advance.
