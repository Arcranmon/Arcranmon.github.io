These 'weapons' are that in mechanics only; unarmed weapons represent punches, kicks, and all other strikes making use of the body. While they deal little damage, unarmed strikes are Fluid, making them easy to Improvise when needed and tend to be incredibly useful for inflicting status conditions. All characters have access to the Hand and Slam weapons but must unlock more specialized unarmed weapons by learning Techniques with the Martial keyword. Many of these advanced unarmed weapons that can be learned by a character provide Momentum or Defensive Tokens on a Crit, making them an effective tool for enabling powerful offensive and defensive abilities.
