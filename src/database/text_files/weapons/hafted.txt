This class of weapons makes use of their weight to deal devastating damage. Comprised largely of axes and hammers, these weapons excel at dealing with _Armor_ and, with their top-heavy damage profile, reward _Evading_ and punish _Warding_. With massive criticals, hafted weapons are the favorite of those that prefer a high-risk, high-reward playstyle.
