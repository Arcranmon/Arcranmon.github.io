An extremely broad category of weapons, improvised weapons comprise anything that is not a conventional weapon. Whether it be throwing a rock, smashing a chair over a creature's head, or using a heavy tree branch as a club, these improvised weapon exist largely to cover weapons that are not explicitly defined. While they deal slightly lower damage, they easily inflict _Vulnerable_ due to the unexpected nature of the attack, setting up large amounts of future damage. Improvised weapons vary in damage type; consult the Spirit Master to determine the type.
