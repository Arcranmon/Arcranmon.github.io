An extremely broad category of weapons, improvised weapons comprise anything that is not a conventional weapon. Whether it be throwing a weapon not meant to be thrown, smashing a chair over a creature's head, or using a heavy tree branch, these improvised weapon exist largely to cover weapons that are not explicitly defined. While they deal slightly lower damage, they easily inflict Vulnerable due to the unexpected nature of the string, setting up large amounts of future damage. Improvised weapons vary in damage type; consult the Spirit Master to determine the type.
