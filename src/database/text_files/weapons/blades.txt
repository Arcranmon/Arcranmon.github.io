Comprising most edged weapons, blades are characterized by their ability to inflict Bleed and their top-heavy damage profiles. While any attack at Disadvatange with a blade is unlikely to inflict serious damage, a Crit with these weapons deals heavy damage. Blade weapons also tend to support a balance between offense and defense, allowing a flexible approach to combat.
