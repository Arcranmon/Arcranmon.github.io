An irregular class of weapons, Spirit Weapons are powerful, impermanent weapons that are conjured through a spiritbound's techniques. They tend to have more specialized powers and, while many can be broken, they can be simply reformed by the spiritbound with little difficulty. These weapons frequently excel at inflicting elemental status conditions and deal diverse types of damage.
