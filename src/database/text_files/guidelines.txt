Action Damage Per Speed:
    - Damage should be equal to Speed + 2 in most cases per AP.
    - An Area of Effect should reduce this; by half if it's likely to hit two creatures, more if it's likely to hit additional.
    - Attacks that apply premium conditions should do a bit less damage.
    - Reach weapons should do a bit less damage per Speed.
    - Light weapons should underperform at their base Speed, overperform at Speed-1 (by about 0.5 damage)
    - 2 Momentum is ~= a Minor Attack.

Attack Profile Guidelines:
    - Accurate Attack: Graze 3+, Hit 5+
    - Standard Attack: Graze 4+, Hit 6+
    - Inaccurate Attack: Graze 5+, Hit 7+
    - Anti-Block should have high-variance damage.
    - Anti-Dodge should have low-variance damage.
    - Most attacks should strive for ~1 damage difference per tier, if possible.

Movement Guidelines:
    - Movement focused skills should follow the below profile without any Cost:
        1: Reposition
        2: Dash

Conditions Guidelines:
    - Premium:
        - Prone
        - Hobbled

Stance and Style Guidelines:
    - Have 8 'points' to distribute as needed.
    - Any 'Token' gained is worth 1.
    - Weight a Reaction/Maneuver as 1 if a bit better than the norm, 2 if much better.
        - Use Acrobatics as the standard. It's better than Leap, but that's expected for a Stance, so no cost.
    - Same for Effects, above the norm is 1, 2 if much better.
        - Use Acrobat Style's Effect here as well; putting Safe on Leaping is good, but is a 0 point cost. Charge 1 for the free Leap.
