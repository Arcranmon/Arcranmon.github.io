Water is one of the most common elements, but is heavily dependant on managing _Sources_ for their Attacks. A _Minor Source_ is required for essentially every Water Spirit ability, while access to a _Major Source_ will often provide additional bonuses. A Waterbonded will often have access to _Major Sources_, but will not be able to move them, only create _Minor Sources_ from them. Additionally, Waterbonded are the only Spirit type that frequently needs to make use of multiple _Major Sources_ in combat, and can greatly amplify their techniques with it.

Water abilities are _Suppressed_ while in a _Dry_ environment or adjacent to a _Blazing_ space and _Sealed_ when the user is in a _Blazing_ space.
