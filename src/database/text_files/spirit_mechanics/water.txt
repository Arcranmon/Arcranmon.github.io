Water is one of the most common elements, but is heavily dependant on managing _Sources_ for their Attacks. A _Minor Source_ is required for essentially every Water Spirit ability, while access to a _Major Source_ will often provide additional bonuses. A Waterbonded will often have access to _Major Sources_, but will not be able to move them, only create _Minor Sources_ from them. Additionally, Waterbonded are the only Spirit type that frequently needs to make use of multiple _Major Sources_ in combat, and can greatly amplify their techniques with it.

Waterbound act as _Suppressed_ when the user is _Alight_, and _Sealed_ if there is no _Source_ in any adjacent _Area_.
