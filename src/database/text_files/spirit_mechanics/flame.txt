Flame is an element that is able to easily conjure and creature their own _Sources_.  Any space that is not a Water Source is treated as a _Minor Source_ for Flame Spirit abilities, while any _Flame_ Terrain or _Features_ are treated as a _Major Source_, in addition to _Alight_ creatures. Except in extreme circumstances Flamebonded can essentially treat the entire battlefield as a _Minor Source_ as they spread _Major Sources_ across it.

Flame abilities are _Suppressed_ when the user is _Soaked_ or _Frozen_ and _Sealed_ when the user is _Swimming_.
