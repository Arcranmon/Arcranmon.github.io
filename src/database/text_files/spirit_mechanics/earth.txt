Earth is one of the most common elements and can nearly always find a _Source_ in combat. A _Minor Source_ is required for essentially every Earth Spirit ability, while access to a _Major Source_ will often provide additional bonuses. An Earthbonded will have access to _Minor Sources_ in most battles, but may have to create _Major Sources_ through the use of _Maneuvers_ and _Techniques_.

Earthbound act as _Suppressed_ when the user has no _Source_ at their _Position_, and _Sealed_ when there is no _Source_ in their _Arena_ or the user is _Flying_.
