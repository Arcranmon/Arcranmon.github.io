Earth is one of the most common elements, but is heavily dependant on managing _Sources_ for their Attacks. A _Minor Source_ is required for essentially every Earth Spirit ability, while access to a _Major Source_ will often provide additional bonuses. An Earthbonded will have access to _Minor Sources_ in most battles, but may have to create _Major Sources_ through the use of _Maneuvers_ and _Techniques_.
&nbsp;
Earth abilities are _Suppressed_ when the user is not within 2 spaces of a _Source_, and _Sealed_ when there is no _Source_ within 5 spaces or the user is _Flying_.
