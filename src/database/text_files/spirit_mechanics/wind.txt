Wind is an element that hardly has to concern itself with _Sources_. All spaces are a _Minor Source_ for Wind unless specified otherwise. All _Windy_ or _Electric_ _Terrain_ and _Features_ are _Major Sources_ for Wind abilities. Windbonded have a great deal of flexibility, and can typically use their abilities whenever they wish.

Wind abilities are _Suppressed_ when the user is underground and _Sealed_ when the user is fully encased in _Earth_, such as when _Restrained_ by an _Earth_ Ability.
