The weapons that spirits wield are not spears or blades; rather, they are the natural weapons of beasts, whether those be fangs, claws, or more esoteric weapons. Most spirits will have two natural weapons, with the sizes constrained by their form, although some traits may change this.

These weapons are mechanical representations of a broad categories of a natural weapons and should not be taken literally. _Medium Jaws_ can of course represent fangs, mandibles, and other similar weapons, but can just as easily represent a crustacean's pincers or any other creature with a crushing, grasping grip. More importantly, a natural weapon does not have represent a singular part of the creature's body; _Small Jaws_ could be both of a scorpion's claws, and a _Medium Coil_ could easily be several of an octopuses' tentacles. So long as the weapons follow the mechanics of their listing (most importantly, only being able to maintain a single _Grab_ per _Grasping_ Weapon), they may be represented as any part of your spirit's biology.
