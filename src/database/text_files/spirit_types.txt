**Mites**: The least form of a spirit, and essentially just ambient energy. Work a bit like insects; on their own they can barely be considered conscious, but in a large group they can impose their own will. Present in essentially every source of that element, but are always 'pure'.

**Least Spirits**: Small spirits that tend to have a corporeal form, but lack anything more than a basic intelligence. Forms are often loose, but many lesser spirits settle into common forms, giving some reliable natural spirits to interact with. Lesser spirits often roam, and tend to not be anchored to a specific thing. Tend to be purely one element, but some intermixing can begin.

**Lesser Spirits**: These spirits have well-defined physical forms and the intelligence of a smart animal. Spirits bound to a person fall into this category, but also spirits of representing a significant structure for their element such as a large stone, a creek, or a dust devil. Have certain common forms. Tend to be predominately one element, but other elements may be present.

**Minor Spirits**: Spirits that are between a lesser spirit and a major spirit. They tend to express a larger or more pure source of their element, but do not have sufficient power to establish a spiritual domain. These are spirits that might inhabit a stream, an ancient tree, or something of the like.

**Major Spirits**: More powerful spirits that tend to represent a significant expression of their element and tend to have a domain. These are the spirits that often have pacts with towns, and are generally much larger than humans. They represent significant power, and can be considered forces of nature. 

**Great Spirits**: Spirits that represent the true immensity of their element, such as a mountain, a lake, the southern wind, or an entire forest. These spirits are far beyond human potential, and should be dealt with only using extreme caution. They can also represent something more abstract, but is rare.

**Shattered Spirit**: A spirit that has been sundered by some means. These are rarely found in the wilds, and are always a threat. Seem to hunt spiritbound when possible. In some cases, a shattered spirit can be healed, often by restoring their domain or by some other method. Always an antagonist, but can be saved.

**Hollow/Demon**: A spirit that has been influenced by strong emotions and human nature. Typically arises when somebody's spirit is not properly freed after they die. These are powerful spirits, typically beyond what the original spiritbound was capable of, but not an imminent threat. The larger concern is when a natural spirit, often a major spirit associated with a town, is twisted by the greed and nature of humans. These are immensely powerful and often vindictive towards mankind.
