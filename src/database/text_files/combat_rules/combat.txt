### Basic Rules
The following basic rules always hold true:
1. Always round up.
2. When a '/' separates things read it as 'or'. The user may choose any of the options listed and in any combination.

&nbsp;
### Rounds in Shattered Spirits
Combat in Shattered Spirits is split up into _Rounds_, _Phases_, and _Turns_. A _Round_ is a complete cycle of combat, where each _Phase_ is completed. A _Phase_ is a collection of _Turns_ that are all occurring at a similar speed in combat. A _Turn_ is a specific character's opportunity to act in combat, where they can use various _Techniques_ to influence the battle.
&nbsp;
A _Round_ is divided into the following phases:
* **Refresh:** The start of each _Round_. This is not a _Phase_, and no Techniques are used. Many effects use the Refresh Phase as an approximation for the start of a _Round_. During _Refresh_, resolve the following:
    * Choose one if you are not _Staggered_: 
        * A creature changes one of either of their _Stances_.
        * A creature pays 1 _Momentum_ and changes both their _Stances_.
    * Choose one if you are not _Disarmed_:
        * A creature may stop _Wielding_ _Equipment_ of their choice, placing them unattended in their current or adjacent spaces, then _Wields_ any _Equipped_ or adjacent, un-_Equipped_ Equipment.
        * A creature may stop _Wielding_ a _One-Handed_ piece of Equipment but keep it _Equipped_, then _Wields_ a piece of _Equipped_ Equipment.
        * A creature pays 1 _Momentum_ and stops _Wielding_ all _Equipment_ but keep it _Equipped_, then _Wields_ up to two _Equipped_ or adjacent, un-_Equipped_ pieces of Equipment.
    * A creature resolves any effects that occur during _Refresh_.
* **Plotting:** Once Refresh is complete, both the _Spirit Master_ and the Players will all determine what _Technique_ they are making use of in the round. Players and enemies simultaneously select all _Techniques_. Players and the GM should (to the best of their ability) select Techniques independent of one another, but players are free to (and encouraged to!) strategize among themselves when selecting Techniques. This ends when all players and enemies have decided their _Techniques_ for the Round. After all _Techniques_ are selected, the _Speed_ of the _Techniques_ are revealed, but not the effect.
* **Phase 1-8:** These numbered Phases are where the bulk of _Techniques_ will be resolved. _Phases_ are resolved in order, 1-8, with Phase 1 representing the fastest _Techniques_ and Phase 8 representing the slowest. During these _Phases_ characters may also resolve _Maneuvers_. [add more information]
* **End Phase:** The end of the round. No _Techniques_ are used in this _Phase_, but many _Techniques_ and _Hazard_ effects resolve in this window. This is still a _Phase_, and abilities that trigger at the start of a _Phase_ may trigger here.

&nbsp;
Refresh is where a great deal of the decision making in combat will occur. Players may select a single _Technique_ to use each _Round_. Players will choose the _Technique_ they wish to use in the Round, then decide which _Speed_ they wish to use it at. _Techniques_ may be played at any _Speed_ greater than or equal to their listed value.
&nbsp;
An individual _Phase_ is divided into _Turns_, where players and enemies alternate using _Techniques_ and _Maneuvers_. Within a _Phase_, players and enemies will alternate who acts. Typically, players get to act first in the first Phase of combat; after that, the first to act in the next _Phase_ is always the opposite of whatever group finished the current _Phase_. For example, if a player acts last in Phase 2, an enemy gets to act first in Phase 3.
&nbsp;
Whenever it is the player's opportunity to act in a _Phase_ they may choose to use a _Maneuver_. [expand this as mechanics get more ironed out]
&nbsp;
After a _Technique_ is selected during the Plotting Phase a character is committing to using that _Technique_. However, if a character finds they no longer wish to use a _Technique_ selected in the Plotting Phase, they may choose to _Improvise_ a _Technique_ and pay 1 _Momentum_ to replace it with a different _Technique_. This new _Technique_ must have a _Speed_ that is less than or equal to the replaced _Technique_. Some _Techniques_ are easier to _Improvise_ as denoted by the _Fluid_ tag.
&nbsp;
If the _Speed_ of a _Technique_ is modified to be less than 1, instead add _Priority_ and resolve it in _Phase_ 1. If it is modified to be greater than 8, add _Stall_ and resolve it in _Phase_ 8. Use the modified _Speed_ for all effects that depend on the _Speed_ of the Attack.
&nbsp;
### Turns in Shattered Spirits
On **their** _Turn_, a character may do the following:
* Resolve the _Technique_ or _Maneuver_ they're using.
* Use any number of _Stunts_. A given _Stunt_ may only be used once per _Turn_ unless it has the _Repeatable_ keyword.
&nbsp;

Additionally, on **all** _Turns_ (including their own), creatures may do the following:
* Use any number of _Reactions_. A given _Reaction_ only be used once per _Turn_ unless specified otherwise.
* Use any number of _Gambits_.

&nbsp;
### Making Attacks
Throughout Shattered Spirits you will see Techniques that have a _Profile_, or a chart outlining damage and effects for values from 2-12. These are referred to as Attacks, and they are typically used to damage or impair hostile creatures. To make an Attack, you must first make an _Attack Roll_. Roll 2d6 and reference the _Profile_ in the Attack, using the Damage and Status in that row to resolve the Attack. For example, if a creature were to use the Stone Strike Technique from the Boulder Discipline and rolled an 8, they would deal 7 Damage (seen in the Damage column) and inflict _Slowed_ (seen in the Status column) on the foe. 

&nbsp;
**Advantage and Disadvantage:** Sometimes Attacks will have _Advantage_ or _Disadvantage_. An Attack with either rolls 3d6 instead of the normal 2d6. If the Attack has _Advantage_ it uses the highest two rolls to resolve the Attack, while _Disadvantage_ uses the lowest two rolls.
&nbsp;

**Calculating Damage:** When determining how much damage is dealt to a creature, use the following order:
1. Determine the base Damage, as defined by the Chart, Technique, or other Effect.
2. Add any modifiers from the Technique, Maneuvers, or Afflictions, such as _Impaired_ or _Exposed_.
3. Apply _Glancing_.
4. Apply _Vulnerable_.
5. Apply _Guard_.

&nbsp;

**Extreme Rolls:** There are a variety of Reactions and other effects that can influence Attack Rolls, such as the Deflect Basic Skill, which reduces an _Attack Roll_ by 1. Whenever these are applied, resolve them using the modified _Attack Roll_. If an _Attack Roll_ ever ends up above a 12 or below a 2, special circumstances occur:
* <ins>If the Attack Roll is above a 12:</ins> Resolve the Attack using the 12 Result. Deal an additional 2 Damage (if any) and increase the cost to _Negate_ by 1.
* <ins>If the Attack Roll is below 2:</ins> The Attack Misses. Resolve the result as if you rolled a 2.

&nbsp;
**Choosing the Target of an Attack**: When a creature makes an Attack they may target anything within range unless the requirements of said _Technique_ say otherwise. Valid targets are as listed below.
* <ins>Creature:</ins> Resolve the _Attack_ as its _Profile_ dictates.
* <ins>Obstacle:</ins> Resolve the _Attack_ as its _Profile_ dictates. If it would do Damage equal to or greater than the Obstacles _Hardness_, Destroy it. Otherwise, nothing happens. Inflict no Status unless specifically stated in the Attack.

&nbsp;
**Range:** Attacks in Shattered Spirits will have a Range of _Self_, _Melee_, or Ranged. Self-Range Techniques either only affect the user, or are centered on them. Melee may only Target adjacent creatures.
* <ins>Measuring Range</ins>: When measuring range, take the greater of the horizontal and vertical difference between the target and the attacker. If you use the Pythagorean Theorem, I will break into your house and steal your rulebook.
* <ins>Ranged Attacks</ins>: Ranged Attacks take a -1 penalty to the Attack Roll for each hostile creature adjacent to the user. An attacker may negate this by paying 1 _Poise_ per adjacent hostile creature.

&nbsp;
**Areas:** Attacks without a listed Area target only a single creature. Some Attacks, however, target an Area. When this is the case, make a single Attack Roll and apply it to all creatures in the area. [Add images for all of these]
* <ins>Arc</ins>: Pick a space within Range, then choose 3 contiguous spaces adjacent to the target space. Target all spaces within. Draw the Attack Line from the target space. If Range is Self, your space is the target space.
* <ins>Blast</ins>: Pick a space within Range. That space, and all spaces within X, where X is the Blast's value, are targeted. Draw the Attack Line from the target space.
* <ins>Burst</ins>: Pick a space within Range. All spaces within X, where X is the Burst's value, spaces of the space are targeted. The targeted space is not effected. Draw the Attack Line from the target space.
* <ins>Cone</ins>: Pick a space within Range. Draw a triangle so that each side is X spaces long, where X is the Cone value, using the target space as one of the corners. If Range is Self the Cone's origin must be an adjacent space and may not pass through your space. Draw the _Attack Line_ from the starting space.
* <ins>Line</ins>: Pick a space within Range. Draw a straight line from that space in any direction. Target the first X spaces in that line, where X is the Line value. If Range is Self the Line must start in an adjacent space and may not pass through your space. Draw the _Attack Line_ from the starting space.
* <ins>Wide Line</ins>: Pick a space within Range. Draw a straight line from that space in any direction. Target the first X spaces in that line, where X is the first numerical value. Additionally, make an additional X identical lines, where X is the second numerical value. These lines must be parallel and adjacent to another line created by this effect. If Range is Self all lines must start in an adjacent space and may not pass through your space. Draw the _Attack Line_ from the starting space of each line.


&nbsp;
**Modifiers to Attacks**: 
When making an Attack a character should draw a line from the center of their space to the center of the target space (called the Attack Line from here on) to determine any additional modifiers to the attack:
* <ins>Attack Line and Obstacles</ins>: Check the following, in descending order:
    * <ins>Obstacles Adjacent to the Target</ins>: If the Attack Line passes through an Obstacle adjacent to the Target with a _Total Height_ greater than or equal to the Target's _Total Height_, they are _Covered_.
    * <ins>Passing Fully Through Obstacles</ins>: If the Attack Line passes through an Obstacle and comes out of non-adjacent sides of said Obstacle:
        * The Target is _Heavily Obstructed_ if the Obstacle's _Total Height_ is equal to yours and greater than or equal to the Target's _Total Height_.
        * The Target is _Covered_ if the Obstacle's _Total Height_ is greater than yours and greater than or equal to the Target's _Total Height_. 
    * <ins>Passing Partly Through Obstacles</ins>: If the Attack Line passes through an Obstacle and comes out adjacent sides they are instead _Lightly Obstructed_ if the Obstacle's _Total Height_ is equal or greater than to yours and equal to or greater than the Target's .
* <ins>Attacking Creatures at Higher Elevation</ins>: A Target at a higher Elevation is _Lightly Obstructed_ unless all spaces the Attack Line passes through are at a lower Elevation than the Target.
* <ins>Arcing</ins>: Arcing is a special keyword, used when an attack is able to fly high through the sky before hitting its target. Arcing Attacks treat _Covered_ granted by Obstacles as _Heavily Obstructed_, and _Heavily Obstructed_ granted by Obstacles as _Lightly Obstructed_, so long as a path exists over Obstacles that can reach the Target.
* <ins>Winding</ins>: For a Winding Attack, instead of drawing a straight Attack Line, instead draw a line however you wish. The Attack may only pass through a number of spaces equal to your Range. Determine _Covered_/_Obstructed_ as normal based on this Attack Line.
* <ins>Secondary Senses</ins>: Secondary Senses allow characters to perceive enemies in ways other than sight. On its own, a Secondary Sense just allows a character to ignore most effects that grant _Veiled_ but, when coupled with _Arcing_ or _Winding_ Attack, also allow the character to ignore _Obstructed_.

### Defending
After being attacked, taking Damage, or gaining Status a creature may expend any amount of _Block_, _Dodge_, or _Poise_ they have for the following effects:
* <ins>Any:</ins> Negate an afflicted Status with the listed cost (for example, you may spend 2 _Block_ to Negate _Grappled_ (2 _Block_)).
* <ins>1 _Block_:</ins> Gain 1 _Guard_ against the Attack. This may not increase a creature's _Guard_ above 4.
* <ins>1 _Block_:</ins> Reduce a _Forced Movement_ effect by 1. A creature may choose this option multiple times.
* <ins>1 _Dodge_:</ins> Roll a 2d6, take the lower value, then reduce the _Attack Roll_ by half that value. A creature may instead spend 2 _Dodge_ to simply roll a single d6, or 3 _Dodge_ to roll 2d6 and take the higher.
* <ins>1 _Dodge_: If you take Damage with the [_Avoidable_] tag, reduce the Damage by 2. A creature may choose this option multiple times.
* <ins>1 _Dodge_:</ins> Reduce the _Value_ of _Wounded_ inflicted by 1, starting with the smallest Token.
* <ins>2 _Block_/_Dodge_:</ins> Reduce the _Value_ of _Hobbled_ inflicted by 1, starting with the smallest Token.
* <ins>1 _Focus_:</ins> Reduce the _Value_ of _Impaired_ or _Exposed_ inflicted by 1, starting with the smallest Token.

&nbsp;

Some _Maneuvers_ may provide alternate ways to spend _Block_, _Dodge_, and _Poise_ or provide additional of these.

&nbsp;
### Movement
In battle a character's mobility is defined by their Movement. How far a character may move is defined by both the armor they are wearing as well as the Technique they are utilizing.

Beyond the simple number of spaces a character is able to move and the effects of terrain, there are a few additional effects that limit the movement of characters, as defined below:

&nbsp;
- <ins>Jumping</ins>: When a character Jumps, they may count Movement up to their Jump value as _Leaping_ Movement. This Movement must be taken in a straight line, and this Movement may not be broken up.
- <ins>Swimming</ins>: While moving through water that a character cannot stand in each space costs twice as much to enter. In addition, while Swimming, a creature is _Heavily Obstructed_, _Disadvantage_ on all Attacks, and creatures have _Advantage_ on Attacks against them.
- <ins>Climbing</ins>: When moving to a higher elevation that forces a character to climb, the total Movement expended is equal to 1 + twice the Elevation change. For example, it would cost a creature 3 spaces of Movement to Climb up a 1 Height Obstacle.  If a creature ends their turn while _Climbing_, creatures have _Advantage_ on Attacks against them.
- <ins>Falling</ins>: If a creature moves from one Elevation to another they must pay _Reflex_ equal to one less than the total Elevation change or else take Crush Damage equal to twice the Elevation Change. If a creature would take at least 6 Damage in this way they also fall _Prone_.

&nbsp;
### Health and Healing
* <ins>Endurance</ins> represents a character's ability to defend themselves. While a character has _Endurance_ they are taking little damage; they are narrowly avoiding attacks, shrugging off blows, or otherwise taking superficial damage. If a character ever has no _Endurance_ they become _Winded_, severly limiting their offensive potential. Characters typically start combat encounters with full _Endurance_.
* <ins>Health</ins> is a character's ability to take physical damage. When a character is losing _Health_ they are becoming injured and taking serious hits that will leave a mark. If a character has no _Health_ they become _Downed_ and immediately lose one _Condition_.
* <ins>Vigor</ins> represents a character's fighting spirit and sudden surges of energy in battle, and is typically only gained in combat. Vigor is always lost before _Endurance_ or _Health_. _Vigor_ does not stack; if a character would gain _Vigor_ while they already have it they must choose whether to keep their current amount of _Vigor_ or replace it with the value they would gain.

&nbsp;
### Open and Hidden Information
**Open Information**: Players should <ins>always</ins> have access to the following information, either openly or by asking the Spirit Master:
* The victory condition for the current encounter.
* An approximation of a creature's _Health_ to the closest 25%.
* What _Statuses_ and _Afflictions_ a creature is currently suffering from.
* When/how any _Hazards_ on the battlefield will trigger, and the approximate consequence for doing so (i.e., 'you will be hit by an attack that might inflict _Shock_').
&nbsp;

**Almost-Open Information:** Players should learn the following information after damaging a creature or afflicting an _Affliction_ or _Status_:
* If any damage they dealt was _Resisted_.
* If the Target _Negated_ or was Immune to any afflicted __Status_.
* The Target's _Guard_.
&nbsp;

**Hidden Information:** Players should not know the following information unless a _Technique_ reveals it and, additionally, the Spirit Master should not know the following information about player characters unless a _Technique_ reveals it:
* What _Techniques_ a creature is using (before the creature resolves said _Techniques_).
* A creature's exact, current _Health_.
* How many of each _Token_ a creature has.
* The creature's current _Stances_, and what benefits they have.
