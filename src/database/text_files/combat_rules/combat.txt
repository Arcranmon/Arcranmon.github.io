4. This game is to be played on a hex map.

&nbsp;
### Rounds in Shattered Spirits
Combat in Shattered Spirits is split up into _Rounds_, _Phases_, and _Turns_. A _Round_ is a complete cycle of combat, where each _Phase_ is completed. A _Phase_ is a collection of _Turns_ that are all occurring at a similar speed in combat. A _Turn_ is a specific character's opportunity to act in combat, where they can use various _Techniques_ to influence the battle.
&nbsp;
A _Round_ is structured as follows:
**Respite:** The start of each _Round_. This is not a _Phase_, and no Techniques are used. During Respite, resolve the following in the following order:
* Trigger any 'Respite begins' abilities.
* Use _Draw/Stow_, reducing its _Cost_ by 1.
* You and your spirit set your _Stamina_ to its maximum value and reset your _AP_.
* Resolve the effects of Wounds and other persistent afflictions the character has:
    * Gain 1 _Vulnerable_ for every 2 _Hunger_/_Thirst_.
    * Gain 1 _Exposed_ for every 2 _Fatigue_.
    * For every _Wound_ that defines a Status, gain the outlined Status.
* Resolve any  other effects that occur during _Respite_.

&nbsp; 
**Plotting:** Once Respite is complete, both the _Spirit Master_ and the Players will all determine what _Technique_ they are making use of in the round. Players may select a single _Technique_ to use each _Round_. Players will choose the _Technique_ they wish to use in the Round, then decide which _Speed_ they wish to use it at. What Speeds a _Technique_ may be played at is specified in its stats. When playing a _Technique_ consult the _Speed_ of any _Attacks_ you hope to make as a part of it; that may impact the _Speed_ you wish to play it at! (See _Speed Penalty_) 

&nbsp; 

Players and enemies simultaneously select all _Techniques_. Players and the GM should (to the best of their ability) select Techniques independent of one another, but players are free to (and encouraged to!) strategize among themselves when selecting Techniques. This ends when all players and enemies have decided their _Techniques_ for the Round. Players and most enemies choose a single Technique, but more advanced enemies may be able to use multiple in a single round.

&nbsp; 
After all _Techniques_ are selected, the _Speed_ of the _Techniques_ are revealed (but not the effect!) and the round begins!

&nbsp;
**Phase 1-8:** These numbered Phases are where the bulk of _Techniques_ will be resolved. _Phases_ are resolved in order, 1-8, with Phase 1 representing the fastest _Techniques_ and Phase 8 representing the slowest. During these _Phases_ characters may also resolve _Maneuvers_. Characters may use as many abilities as they wish per Phase, but only one may be a Technique or Action. At the end of _Phase_ 8 any effects that trigger at the end of a _Phase_ (such as a _Charged Attack_) immediately end unless otherwise specified.
**End of Round:** The end of the Round. Many _Techniques_ and _Hazard_ effects resolve in this window. 

&nbsp;
An individual _Phase_ is divided into _Turns_, where players and enemies alternate using _Techniques_ and _Maneuvers_. Within a _Phase_, players and enemies will alternate who acts. Typically, players get to act first in the first Phase of combat; after that, the first to act in the next _Phase_ is always the opposite of whatever group finished the current _Phase_. For example, if a player acts last in Phase 2, an enemy gets to act first in Phase 3.
&nbsp;
Whenever it is the player's opportunity to act in a _Phase_ they may choose to use a _Maneuver_. If they pass, their opponents get the same opportunity, with the _Turns_ alternating as normal. If both sides pass, continue to the next _Phase_.
&nbsp;
After a _Technique_ is selected during the Plotting Phase a character is committing to using that _Technique_. However, if a character finds they no longer wish to use a _Technique_ selected in the Plotting Phase, they may choose to _Improvise_ a _Technique_ and pay 2 _Momentum_ to replace it with a different _Technique_. This new _Technique_ must have a _Speed_ that is valid for the current _Phase_. Some _Techniques_ are easier to _Improvise_ as denoted by the _Fluid_ tag.
&nbsp;
If the _Speed_ of a _Technique_ is modified to be less than 1, instead add _Priority_ and resolve it in _Phase_ 1. If it is modified to be greater than 8, add _Stall_ and resolve it in _Phase_ 8. Use the modified _Speed_ for all effects that depend on the _Speed_ of the ability.

&nbsp;

### Turns in Shattered Spirits
On **their** _Turn_, a character may do the following:
* Resolve the _Technique_ or _Action_ they're using.
* Use any number of _Stunts_. A given _Stunt_ may only be used once per _Turn_ unless it has the _Repeatable_ keyword.
&nbsp;

Additionally, on **all** _Turns_ (including their own), creatures may do the following:
* Use any number of _Reactions_. A given _Reaction_ only be used once per _Turn_ unless specified otherwise, and only one _Reaction_ may be used against a specific trigger.
* Use any number of _Gambits_.

&nbsp;

### Manifest Abilities
Every _Round_ a character may use a single ability with the _Manifest_ keyword. These are powerful abilities that summon their spirit onto the battlefield. Characters may always use the basic _Swift Manifestation_ ability, but many abilities provided by Spirit Disciplines have a _Manifest_ option, which typically allows it to be used at no _AP_ cost and may provide additional benefits.
&nbsp;
If characters respite a great deal of _Momentum_ they can use the _Spirit Summon_ maneuver to bring forth their spirit in a physical form, allowing it to participate in the battle as an active combatant this round.

&nbsp;

### Making Attacks
Throughout Shattered Spirits you will see Techniques that have a _Profile_, or a chart outlining damage and effects for values from 2-12. These are referred to as Attacks, and they are typically used to damage or impair hostile creatures. To make an Attack, you must first make an _Attack Roll_. Roll 2d6 and reference the _Profile_ in the Attack, using the Damage and Status in that row to resolve the Attack. For example, if a creature were to use the _Chip Shot_ Attack from the Basic Mountain Arts and rolled an 8, they would deal 6 Damage (seen in the Damage column) and inflict _Exposed_ 1 (seen in the Status column) on the foe. 

&nbsp;
**Advantage and Disadvantage:** Sometimes Attacks will have _Advantage_ or _Disadvantage_. An Attack with either rolls 3d6 instead of the normal 2d6. If the Attack has _Advantage_ it uses the highest two rolls to resolve the Attack, while _Disadvantage_ uses the lowest two rolls. If an Attack has both _Advantage_ and _Disadvantage_ they offset one another at a 1-to-1 rate. If an Attack has multiple instances of _Advantage_/_Disadvantage_ any additional instances are instead converted to a _Bonus_/_Penalty_.
&nbsp;

**Calculating Damage:** When determining how much damage is dealt to a creature, use the following order:
1. Determine the base Damage, as defined by the Chart, Technique, or other Effect.
2. Add any modifiers from the Technique, Maneuvers, or Afflictions, such as _Impaired_ or _Exposed_.
3. Apply _Glancing_.
4. Apply _Vulnerable_.
5. Apply _Guard_.

**Resolving Attacks:** When resolving the effects of an Attack, deal all Damage prior to resolving any Status. Additionally, the Target of an Attack should be aware of the Damage and Status that would be inflicted prior to using Reactions.

&nbsp;

**Extreme Rolls:** There are a variety of Reactions and other effects that can influence Attack Rolls, such as the Deflect Basic Skill, which reduces an _Attack Roll_ by 1. Whenever these are applied, resolve them using the modified _Attack Roll_. If an _Attack Roll_ ever ends up above a 12 or below a 2, special circumstances occur:
* <ins>If the Attack Roll is above a 12:</ins> Resolve the Attack using the 12 Result. Deal an additional 2 Damage (if any) and add _Dazed_ 1.
* <ins>If the Attack Roll is below 2:</ins> The Attack Misses. Resolve the result as if you rolled a 2.

&nbsp;
**Choosing the Target of an Attack**: When a creature makes an Attack they may target anything within range unless the requirements of said _Technique_ say otherwise. Valid targets are as listed below.
* <ins>Creature:</ins> Resolve the _Attack_ as its _Profile_ dictates.
* <ins>Obstacle:</ins> Resolve the _Attack_ as its _Profile_ dictates. If the total Damage + _Forced Movement_ is equal to or greater than the Obstacles _Hardness_, Destroy it. Otherwise, nothing happens. Inflict no Status unless specifically stated in the Attack. If you needed _Forced Movement_ to _Destroy_ the _Obstacle_ the _Destroy_ effect *must* be resolved in that direction, if applicable.

&nbsp;
**Range:** Attacks in Shattered Spirits will have a Range of _Self_, _Melee_, or Ranged. Self-Range Techniques either only affect the user, or are centered on them. Melee may only Target adjacent creatures.
* <ins>Measuring Range</ins>: When measuring range, take the greater of the horizontal and vertical difference between the target and the attacker. If you use the Pythagorean Theorem, I will break into your house and steal your rulebook.
* <ins>Ranged Attacks</ins>: Ranged Attacks take a -1 penalty to the Attack Roll for each hostile creature adjacent to the user. An attacker may negate this by paying 1 _Momentum_ per adjacent hostile creature.

&nbsp;
**Areas:** Attacks without a listed Area target only a single creature. Some Attacks, however, target an Area. When this is the case, make a single Attack Roll and apply it to all creatures in the area. [Add images for all of these]
* <ins>Arc</ins>: Pick a space within Range. Target all spaces as if this was a _Burst_ X, but only target one side of the burst. For example, a _Self_ Range _Arc_ 1 would be the three contiguous spaces adjacent to a Size 1 creature.
* <ins>Blast</ins>: Pick a space within Range. That space, and all spaces within X, where X is the Blast's value, are targeted. Draw the Attack Line from the target space.
* <ins>Burst</ins>: Pick a space within Range. All spaces within X, where X is the _Burst_'s value, spaces of the space are targeted. The targeted space is not affected. Draw the Attack Line from the target space.
* <ins>Cone</ins>: Pick a space within Range. Draw a triangle so that each side is X spaces long, where X is the Cone value, using the target space as one of the corners. If Range is Self the Cone's origin must be an adjacent space and may not pass through your space. Draw the _Attack Line_ from the starting space.
* <ins>Line</ins>: Pick a space within Range. Draw a straight line from that space in any direction. Target the first X spaces in that line, where X is the Line value. If Range is Self the Line must start in an adjacent space and may not pass through your space. Draw the _Attack Line_ from the starting space.
* <ins>Wide Line</ins>: Pick a space within Range. Draw a straight line from that space in any direction. Target the first X spaces in that line, where X is the first numerical value. Additionally, make an additional X identical lines, where X is the second numerical value. These lines must be parallel and adjacent to another line created by this effect. If Range is Self all lines must start in an adjacent space and may not pass through your space. Draw the _Attack Line_ from the starting space of each line.

&nbsp;

### Defending
After being attacked, taking Damage, or gaining Status a creature may expend any amount of _Stamina_ they have for the following effects:
* <ins>Any:</ins> Negate an afflicted Status with the listed cost (for example, you may spend 2 _Stamina_ to Negate _Grappled_ (2 _Stamina_)).
* <ins>1 _Stamina_:</ins> If you take Damage with the _Avoidable_, _Endurable_, or _Mental_ tag, reduce the Damage by 2. A creature may choose this option multiple times.

&nbsp;

A character must spend _Stamina_ immediately after the triggering Attack/Damage/Status; if, for example, a creature is hit by 3 Attacks in the same Turn, they must resolve all potential _Reactions_ and the spending of _Stamina_ against the first Attack before the second is made.

&nbsp;

### Movement
In battle a character's mobility is defined by their Movement. How far a character may move is defined by their _Load_ and the move distance listed in the ability they're using. Whenever a character starts a Move they create an _Opening_. Additionally, characters may break up their Movement however they wish, but if they make an _Attack_ treat resuming their Movement as starting a new Move. This creates an [_Opening_] as normal and removes any effects such as [_Safe_] that the original had.
&nbsp;
Beyond the simple number of spaces a character is able to move and the effects of terrain, there are a few additional effects that limit the movement of characters, as defined below:
- <ins>Swimming</ins>: While moving through water that a character cannot stand in each space costs twice as much to enter. In addition, while Swimming, a creature has _Heavy Cover_, _Disadvantage_ on all Attacks, and creatures have _Advantage_ on Attacks against them.
- <ins>Climbing</ins>: When moving to a higher or lower elevation the total Movement expended is equal to twice the Elevation change. For example, it would cost a creature 2 spaces of Movement to Climb up a 1 Height Obstacle. While _Climbing_ a creature has _Disadvantage_ on all Attacks and Attacks against them have _Advantage_.
- <ins>Falling</ins>: If a creature moves from one Elevation to a lower _Elevation_ they take Crush Damage equal to twice the Elevation Change. If a creature takes at least 6 Damage in this way they also fall _Prone_. A creature may reduce this Damage by 2 for every _Stamina_ spent. If a creature changes _Elevation_ using their Movement they reduce the _Elevation_ change by their _Jump_ value for the purposes of calculating damage.

&nbsp;

### Health and Wounds
* <ins>Health</ins> represents a character's ability to defend themselves. While a character has _Health_ they are taking little damage; they are narrowly avoiding attacks, shrugging off blows, or otherwise taking superficial damage. When a character loses all their _Health_ they roll for _Wounds_, then increment their _Downed_ tracker. Characters typically start combat encounters with full _Health_.
* <ins>Vigor</ins> represents a character's fighting spirit and sudden surges of energy in battle, and is typically only gained in combat. Vigor is always lost before _Health_. _Vigor_ does not stack; if a character would gain _Vigor_ while they already have it they must choose whether to keep their current amount of _Vigor_ or replace it with the value they would gain.
* <ins>Wounds</ins> occur when a character is _Downed_. If a character has open lines in their Strain Meter, place the _Wounds_ there. Otherwise, replace a non-_Wound_ line with the _Wound_. If the _Wound_ has a count greater than one, split it across multiple lines. For example, _Bleeding_ 3 would be three individual lines, each of _Bleeding_ 1.
* <ins>Downed</ins> occurs when a creature's _Health_ reaches 0. For most NPCs, this means they are immediately _Defeated_. Player characters and more powerful NPCs instead roll for _Wounds_, which is done by rolling a number of d6s based on the number of times they have been _Downed_ prior to this. After gaining _Wounds_ a character is reset to full _Health_.
    * **First Down:** Roll 2d6 and use the lowest.
    * **Future Downs:** Roll Xd6 and take the highest result, where X is the number of times prior to this you have been _Downed_.
    * A character clears the number of times they have been Downed when they rest in a _Haven_.
* <ins>Spirit Downed</ins> occurs when a character's spirit's _Health_ reaches 0. When a _Spirit_ is _Downed_ that character becomes _Suppressed_ for the remainder of the _Round_ (or _Sealed_ if they are already _Suppressed_), and may not use a _Manifest_ ability this _Round_. Additionally, the spirit marks one against their _Spirit Track_. At the start of the next_Phase_ the spirit is reset to full _Health_.
* <ins>Death</ins>: It is extremely rare for a character to be killed in combat in Shattered Spirits. Characters only die when their entire Strain Meter is full of _Wounds_.

&nbsp;
### Cover
When determining Cover, characters should draw a line from the center of the Attack's origin space to the center of the target's space, referred to as the Attack Line:
* <ins>_Light Cover_</ins>: If the Attack Line passes through an Obstacle with a _Total Height_ equal to or greater than yours and the Target's and comes out an adjacent side, the Target has _Light Cover_.
* <ins>_Heavy Cover_</ins>:  If the Attack Line passes through an Obstacle with a _Total Height_ equal to or greater than yours and the Target's and comes out of non-adjacent sides of said Obstacle, the Target has _Heavy Cover_.
* <ins>_Full Cover_</ins>: If a creature is adjacent to an Obstacle with a _Total Height_ greater than or equal to their own and the Attack Line passes through said Obstacle and comes out of non-adjacent sides of it, the Target has _Cover_.
* <ins>Arcing</ins>: Arcing is a special keyword, used when an attack is able to fly high through the sky before hitting its target. Arcing Attacks treat all _Cover_ as one level less, so long as a path exists over _Obstacles_ that can reach the Target.
* <ins>Winding</ins>: For a Winding Attack, instead of drawing a straight Attack Line, instead draw a line however you wish. The Attack may only pass through a number of spaces equal to your Range. Determine _Cover_ as normal based on this Attack Line.

&nbsp;
### Vision
When determining Vision, characters should draw a line from the center of the Attacker's space to the center of the target's space:
* <ins>_Lightly Obscured_</ins>: If this line clips an Obstacle of a _Total Height_ greater than yours and the target's or some _Terrain_ effects, they are _Lightly Obscured_. This has no impact on its  own, but works in conjunction with some effects such as _Stealthy_.
* <ins>_Heavily Obscured_</ins>:  If this line fully passes through an Obstacle of a _Total Height_ greater than yours and the target's, they are _Heavily Obscured_. A creature that is _Heavily Obscured_ may not be targeted.
* <ins>Secondary Senses</ins>: Secondary Senses allow characters to perceive enemies in ways other than sight. When using a _Secondary Sense_, ignore the normal rules for determining Obscured and follow the rules of the _Secondary Sense_.

&nbsp;

### Open and Hidden Information
**Open Information**: Players should <ins>always</ins> have access to the following information, either openly or by asking the Spirit Master:
* The victory condition for the current encounter.
* An approximation of a creature's _Health_ to the closest 25%.
* What _Statuses_ and _Afflictions_ a creature is currently suffering from.
* When/how any _Hazards_ on the battlefield will trigger, and the approximate consequence for doing so (i.e., 'you will be hit by an attack that might inflict _Shocked_').
&nbsp;

**Almost-Open Information:** Players should learn the following information after damaging a creature or afflicting an _Affliction_ or _Status_:
* If any damage they dealt was _Resisted_.
* If the Target _Negated_ or was Warded to any afflicted __Status_.
* The Target's _Guard_.
* Once _Plotting_ is complete, what _Phase_ all creatures are acting in.
* How much _Stamina_ that creature has remaining.
&nbsp;

**Hidden Information:** Players should not know the following information unless a _Technique_ reveals it and, additionally, the Spirit Master should not know the following information about player characters unless an ability reveals it:
* What _Techniques_ a creature is using (before the creature resolves said _Techniques_).
* A creature's exact, current _Health_.
* The creature's current _Stances_, and what benefits they have.

&nbsp;

### Miscellaneous
* If the Cost of an ability is reduced to less than 0, any remaining reduction may be used on Boosts.
* For _Terrain_:
    * A creature may only be impacted by a given space once per _Turn_.
    * Damaging Terrain may not impact a creature more times than their _Size_ for each space moved.
    * Terrain that imposes conditions or limits mobility only applies to a creature if at least half of their spaces are that _Terrain_.
* For _Status_:
    * When Statuses react with an effect, ignore all _Weakness_/_Resistance_ and similar from said Status when resolving the reaction.
    * A Statuses reaction may not trigger another of its own Reactions.
* Whenever an ability refers to a 'straight line' draw a line from the center of one hex to another. When drawing the path for the effect you may only travel through spaces that the line goes through. If the line passes through multiple adjacent hexes, choose one. You may not pass through any of the hexes not selected at this step.
