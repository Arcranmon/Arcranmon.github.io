### Rounds in Shattered Spirits
Combat in Shattered Spirits is split up into _Rounds_, _Phases_, and _Turns_. A _Round_ is a complete cycle of combat, where each _Phase_ is completed. A _Phase_ is a collection of _Turns_ that are all occurring at a similar speed in combat. A _Turn_ is a specific character's opportunity to act in combat, where they can use various _Techniques_ to influence the battle.
&nbsp;
A _Round_ is divided into the following phases:
* **Plotting Phase:** In the Plotting Phase, both the Guardian Spirit and the Players will all determine what _Techniques_ they are making use of in the round. No _Techniques_ resolve during the Plotting Phase; it exists simply for players and the Guardian Spirit to decide their _Techniques_ for the round. Unlike the other Phases, players and enemies go simultaneously in this _Phase_. This _Phase_ ends when all players and enemies have decided their _Techniques_ for the Round.
* **Instinctive Phase:** The Instinctive Phase is for _Techniques_ that are nearly as fast as the speed of thought. It is the first _Phase_ where _Techniques_ may be resolved, but typically _Techniques_ in this _Phase_ do not provide _Movement_, and do not target other creatures in a meaningful way.
* **Refresh Phase:** This _Phase_ occurs right before the start of the _Technique_-heavy _Phases_. Many _Stances_ and _Styles_ use the Refresh Phase to either grant a creature resources or as an approximation for the start of a _Round_.
* **Phase 1-6:** These numbered Phases are where the bulk of _Techniques_ will be resolved. _Phases_ are resolved in order, 1-6, with Phase 1 representing the fastest _Techniques_ and Phase 6 representing the slowest.

&nbsp;
The Plotting Phase is where a great deal of the decision making in combat will occur. A Player has 3 Action Points or _AP_ that they can divide among _Techniques_ as they wish. Players will choose the _Techniques_ they wish to use in the Round, then decide which _Speed_ they wish to play them at. In almost every case this is the listed _Speed_ of the _Technique_, although some _Stances_ and _Styles_ permit changes to the _Speed_ of _Techniques_. The exception are _Techniques_ with the _Set-Up_ or _Follow-Up_ _Speed_; rather than being played in a specific _Phase_, they are attached to another _Technique_ that lacks the _Set-Up_ or _Follow-Up_ _Speed_. These _Techniques_ are resolved on the same _Turn_ as the _Technique_ it is attached to. _Set-Up_ is resolved immediately before the _Technique_, while _Follow-Up_ resolves immediately after.
&nbsp;
An individual _Phase_ is divided into _Turns_, where players and enemies alternate using _Techniques_. Within a _Phase_, players and enemies will alternate who acts. Typically, players get to act first in the first Instinctive Phase of combat; after that, the first to act in the next _Phase_ is always the opposite of whatever group finished the current _Phase_. For example, if a player acts last in Phase 2, an enemy gets to act first in Phase 3.
&nbsp;
Making more than a single _Strike_ per _Round_ is difficult and requires significant _Momentum_. Using a second _Strike_ with an _AP_ cost in the same _Round_ increases its _Cost_ by 2 _Momentum_, while a third increases its _Cost_ by 4 _Momentum_.
&nbsp;
After a _Technique_ is selected during the Plotting Phase a character is committing to using that _Technique_. However, if a character finds they no longer wish to use a _Technique_ selected in the Plotting Phase, they may choose to _Improvise_ a _Technique_ and pay 2 _Momentum_ to replace it with a different _Technique_. This new _Technique_ must have the same _AP_ cost and a _Speed_ that is less than or equal to the replaced _Technique_. Some _Techniques_ are easier to _Improvise_ as denoted by the _Fluid_ tag.

&nbsp;
### Making Attacks
When a creature makes an Attack they may target anything within range unless the requirements of said _Technique_ say otherwise. Valid targets are as listed below.
* <ins>Creature:</ins> Resolve the _Attack_ as its _Profile_ dictates.
* <ins>Obstacle:</ins> Resolve the _Attack_ as its _Profile_ dictates. If it would do Damage equal to or greater than the Obstacles _Durability_, Destroy it. Otherwise, nothing happens. Inflict no Status unless specifically stated in the Attack.
* <ins>Equipment:</ins> Resolve the Attack as its _Profile_ dictates, at _Disadvantage_ if the piece of _Equipment_ is _Worn_ or _Wielded_. If it would do Damage equal to or greater than the _Equipment_'s _Durability_ the _Equipment_ becomes _Damaged_. Even if the _Equipment_ is not _Damaged_, you may pay 1 _Momentum_ on a Hit or Crit to attempt to _Disarm_ that piece of _Equipment_. The creature may _Negate_ with 1 _Reflex_ or _Grit_ on a Hit, or any 2 of _Reflex_ or _Grit_ on a _Crit_. Inflict no _Status_ unless specifically stated in the Attack.
* <ins>Armor:</ins> Resolve the _Attack_ as its _Profile_ dictates at _Disadvantage_. If it would do Damage equal to or greater than the Armor's _Durability_ plus it's current _Guard_ value inflict _Shred_ 1. Deal half the rolled Damage to the creature wearing the Armor and inflict Status as normal, but reduce the cost to _Negate_ by 1. 
* <ins>Creature Part:</ins> Resolve the _Attack_ as its _Profile_ dictates. Deal the rolled Damage to the Creature Part. Deal half the rolled Damage to the creature and inflict Status as normal, but reduce the cost to _Negate_ by 1.
&nbsp;
For the purpose of any Triggers, an Attack against Armor that is Worn or against Equipment that is Worn or Wielded counts as an _Attack_ against that creature. In general, targeting anything other than a Creature with an _Attack_ granted by a _Maneuver_ is unlikely to cause any effect.
