### Rounds in Shattered Spirits
Combat in Shattered Spirits is split up into _Rounds_, _Phases_, and _Turns_. A _Round_ is a complete cycle of combat, where each _Phase_ is completed. A _Phase_ is a collection of _Turns_ that are all occurring at a similar speed in combat. A _Turn_ is a specific character's opportunity to act in combat, where they can use various _Techniques_ to influence the battle.
&nbsp;
A _Round_ is divided into the following phases:
* **Refresh:** The start of each _Round_. This is not a _Phase_, and no Techniques are used. Many _Stances_ and _Styles_ use the Refresh Phase to either grant a creature resources or as an approximation for the start of a _Round_. First, a character may choose to change one of either their _Stance_ or _Style_, and may draw or stow a Weapon or swap a single hand of _Wielded_ Equipment with _Equipped_ or adjacent, un-_Equipped_ Equipment. A character may pay 1 _Focus_/_Momentum_ to instead change both their _Stance_/_Style_ or swap both hands of _Wielded_ Equipment with _Equipped_ or adjacent, un-_Equipped_ Equipment. Each option must have the cost paid separately. Then, resolve all effects that depends on the _Refresh_ Phase.
* **Plotting:** Both the _Spirit Master_ and the Players will all determine what _Techniques_ they are making use of in the round. No _Techniques_ resolve while Plotting; it exists simply for players and the _Spirit Master_ to decide their _Techniques_ for the round. Unlike the other Phases, players and enemies go simultaneously in this _Phase_. This _Phase_ ends when all players and enemies have decided their _Techniques_ for the Round.
* **Phase 1-6:** These numbered Phases are where the bulk of _Techniques_ will be resolved. _Phases_ are resolved in order, 1-6, with Phase 1 representing the fastest _Techniques_ and Phase 6 representing the slowest.
* **End Phase:** The end of the round. No _Techniques_ are used in this _Phase_, but many _Techniques_ and _Hazard_ effects resolve in this window. This is still a _Phase_, and _Reactions_ and other abilities that trigger at the start of a _Phase_ may trigger here.

&nbsp;
The Plotting Phase is where a great deal of the decision making in combat will occur. A Player has 3 Action Points or _AP_ that they can divide among _Techniques_ as they wish. Players will choose the _Techniques_ they wish to use in the Round, then decide which _Speed_ they wish to play them at. In almost every case this is the listed _Speed_ of the _Technique_, although some _Stances_ and _Styles_ permit changes to the _Speed_ of _Techniques_. Characters may also choose to use any _Enhancements_ they have available by paying their cost and _Attaching_ them to a given _Technique_ at this point.
&nbsp;
An individual _Phase_ is divided into _Turns_, where players and enemies alternate using _Techniques_. Within a _Phase_, players and enemies will alternate who acts. Typically, players get to act first in the first Instinctive Phase of combat; after that, the first to act in the next _Phase_ is always the opposite of whatever group finished the current _Phase_. For example, if a player acts last in Phase 2, an enemy gets to act first in Phase 3.
&nbsp;
After a _Technique_ is selected during the Plotting Phase a character is committing to using that _Technique_. However, if a character finds they no longer wish to use a _Technique_ selected in the Plotting Phase, they may choose to _Improvise_ a _Technique_ and pay 2 _Momentum_ to replace it with a different _Technique_. This new _Technique_ must have the same _AP_ cost and a _Speed_ that is less than or equal to the replaced _Technique_. Some _Techniques_ are easier to _Improvise_ as denoted by the _Fluid_ tag.
&nbsp;
Typically, _Enhancements_ may only be _Attached_ when a _Technique_ is played in the _Plotting Phase_ or when _Improvising_. The exception is _Enhancements_ with the _Flexible_ tag: these may be _Attached_ to a _Technique_ when it is utilized.
&nbsp;
### Reactions
Typically, characters only act on their _Turn_. The exception is _Reactions_, which allow characters to act on others' _Turns_. All _Reactions_ have a _Trigger_, which outlines the scenario that the _Reaction_ may be used under.
&nbsp;
If a Reaction allows the use of a _Technique_, Movement is none unless specified otherwise.

&nbsp;
### Making Attacks
Throughout Shattered Spirits you will see Techniques that have a _Profile_, or a chart outlining damage and effects for values from 2-12. These are referred to as Attacks, and they are typically used to damage or impair hostile creatures. To make an Attack, you must first make an _Attack Roll_. Roll 2d6 and reference the _Profile_ in the Attack, using the Damage and Status in that row to resolve the Attack. For example, if a creature were to use the Stone Strike Technique from the Boulder Discipline and rolled an 8, they would deal 7 Damage (seen in the Damage column) and inflict _Staggered_ (seen in the Status column) on the foe. 

&nbsp;
**Advantage and Disadvantage:** Sometimes Attacks will have _Advantage_ or _Disadvantage_. An Attack with either rolls 3d6 instead of the normal 2d6. If the Attack has _Advantage_ it uses the highest two rolls to resolve the Attack, while _Disadvantage_ uses the lowest two rolls.
&nbsp;

**Calculating Damage:** When determining how much damage is dealt to a creature, use the following order:
1. Determine the base Damage, as defined by the Chart, Technique, or other Effect.
2. Add any modifiers from the Technique or any Enhancements.
3. Apply _Glancing_.
4. Apply _Exposed_.
5. Apply _Guard_.

&nbsp;

**Extreme Rolls:** There are a variety of Reactions and other effects that can influence Attack Rolls, such as the Deflect Basic Skill, which reduces an _Attack Roll_ by 1. Whenever these are applied, resolve them using the modified _Attack Roll_. If an _Attack Roll_ ever ends up above a 12 or below a 2, special circumstances occur:
* <ins>If the Attack Roll is above a 12</ins> Resolve the Attack using the 12 Result. Deal an additional 2 Damage (if any) and increase the cost to _Negate_ by 1.
* <ins>If the Attack Roll is below 2</ins> The Attack Misses. You must pay 1 _Focus_/_Momentum_ or else become _Disarmed_ of a _Wielded_ Item, gain _Exposed_ 2, or become _Prone_. Your _Spirit Master_ chooses the most appropriate effect.

&nbsp;
**Choosing the Target of an Attack**: When a creature makes an Attack they may target anything within range unless the requirements of said _Technique_ say otherwise. Valid targets are as listed below.
* <ins>Creature:</ins> Resolve the _Attack_ as its _Profile_ dictates.
* <ins>Obstacle:</ins> Resolve the _Attack_ as its _Profile_ dictates. If it would do Damage equal to or greater than the Obstacles _Durability_, Destroy it. Otherwise, nothing happens. Inflict no Status unless specifically stated in the Attack.
* <ins>Equipment:</ins> Resolve the Attack as its _Profile_ dictates, at _Disadvantage_ if the piece of _Equipment_ is _Worn_ or _Wielded_. If it would do Damage equal to or greater than the _Equipment_'s _Durability_ the _Equipment_ becomes _Damaged_. Even if the _Equipment_ is not _Damaged_, you may pay 1 _Momentum_ on a _Hit_ or _Crit_ to attempt to _Disarm_ that piece of _Equipment_. The creature may _Negate_ with 1 _Reflex_ or _Grit_ on a _Hit_,  or any 2 of _Reflex_ or _Grit_ on a _Crit_. Inflict no _Status_ unless specifically stated in the Attack.
* <ins>Armor:</ins> Resolve the _Attack_ as its _Profile_ dictates at _Disadvantage_. If it would do Damage equal to or greater than the Armor's _Durability_ plus its current _Guard_ value inflict _Shred_ 1. Additionally, if the Attack is not _Glancing_, resolve the Attack using the same _Attack Roll_ against the creature but add _Glancing_.
* <ins>Creature Part:</ins> Resolve the _Attack_ as its _Profile_ dictates. Deal the rolled Damage to the Creature Part. Resolve the Attack as _Glancing_ against the creature if it was not already _Glancing_. 

&nbsp;
For the purpose of any Triggers, an Attack against Armor that is Worn or against Equipment that is Worn or Wielded counts as an _Attack_ against that creature. In general, targeting anything other than a Creature with an _Attack_ granted by a _Maneuver_ is unlikely to cause any effect.

&nbsp;
### Range
* <ins>Measuring Range</ins>: When measuring range, take the greater of the horizontal and vertical difference between the target and the attacker. If you use the Pythagorean Theorem, I will break into your house and steal your rulebook.
* <ins>Ranged Attacks</ins>: Ranged Attacks take a -1 penalty to the Attack Roll for each hostile creature adjacent to the user. An attacker may negate this by paying 1 _Focus_ per adjacent hostile creature.

&nbsp;
### Elevation
* <ins>High Ground</ins>: When attacking a character that is within their Reach and at a lower Elevation, the attacker gains a +1 bonus to Melee Attack Rolls. When attacking a character that is at a higher Elevation, the attacker takes a -1 penalty to their Melee Attack Rolls.

&nbsp;
### Terrain
* <ins>Cover</ins>: Characters benefit from Cover when they are adjacent to an Obstacle of their Size or larger. Attacks that pass through said Obstacle gain _Glancing_ or, if the Attack already had _Glancing_, the Target gains 2 _Guard_ against the Attack.

&nbsp;
### Movement
In battle a character's mobility is defined by their Movement. How far a character may move is defined by both the armor they are wearing as well as the Technique they are utilizing.

Beyond the simple number of spaces a character is able to move and the effects of terrain, there are a few additional effects that limit the movement of characters, as defined below:

&nbsp;
- <ins>Jumping</ins>: When a character Jumps, they may count Movement up to their Jump value as _Leaping_ Movement. This Movement must be taken in a straight line, and this Movement may not be broken up.
- <ins>Swimming</ins>: While moving through water that a character cannot stand in their Movement is halved, with each space costing twice as much as a space typically takes to move through, similar to _Rough_ Terrain.
- <ins>Climbing</ins>: When moving to a higher elevation that forces a character to climb, the total Movement expended is equal to 1 + twice the vertical distance covered. For example, it would cost a creature 3 spaces of Movement to Climb up a 1 Height Obstacle.
- <ins>Falling</ins>: If a creature moves from one Elevation to another they must pay _Reflex_ equal to one less than the total Elevation change or else take Crush Damage equal to twice the Elevation Change. If a creature would take at least 6 Damage in this way they also fall _Prone_.

&nbsp;
### Tokens
In Shattered Spirits there are 4 Tokens that represent your character's various advantages in combat. These Tokens can be spent through a variety of _Techniques_ to reduce the effectiveness of hostile effects or to enable powerful options in combat.
* <ins>Momentum</ins> is the primary offensive resource in combat. It represents a wide variety of small advantages your character has gained in combat, and can be spent in a variety of ways. Most commonly, _Momentum_ is used to _Improvise_ Actions when no other options are viable, pay the _Cost_ of powerful Techniques and Enhancements or _Boost_ other Techniques to enhance their power.
* <ins>Focus</ins> is a _Defensive Token_ that represents concentration, spirit expertise, and the ability to maintain composure in combat. _Focus_ is often used to fuel some Spirit Reactions, but is most commonly used to negate effects such as _Fear_ or _Grief_. In addition, _Focus_ can often be used in place of _Momentum_ for more defensive actions such as Form Change that allow you to maintain a viable combat stance.
* <ins>Grit</ins> is a _Defensive Token_ that represents toughness, strength, and ability to push the body beyond its limits. _Grit_ is most commonly used to fuel _Block_ _Reactions_ that reduce _Attack Rolls_ directly, but is also commonly used to _Negate_ effects such as _Push_, _Pull_, or _Staggered_.
* <ins>Reflex</ins> is the final _Defensive Token_ which represents mobility and the ability to quickly respond to threats. _Reflex_ is commonly used to fuel _Evade_ Reactions that force a creature to reroll the entire _Attack Roll_ or allow the creature to move outside of their _Turn_. In addition, it is frequently used to _Negate_ effects such as _Hobbled_, _Prone_, and _Burn_.

&nbsp;
### Health and Healing
* <ins>Endurance</ins> represents a character's ability to defend themselves. While a character has _Endurance_ they are taking little damage; they are narrowly avoiding attacks, shrugging off blows, or otherwise taking superficial damage. If a character ever has no _Endurance_ they become _Shaken_, severly limiting their offensive potential. Characters typically start combat encounters with full _Endurance_.
* <ins>Health</ins> is a character's ability to take physical damage. When a character is losing _Health_ they are becoming injured and taking serious hits that will leave a mark. If a character has no _Health_ they become _Downed_ and immediately lose one _Condition_.
* <ins>Vigor</ins> represents a character's fighting spirit and sudden surges of energy in battle, and is typically only gained in combat. Vigor is always lost before _Endurance_ or _Health_. _Vigor_ does not stack; if a character would gain _Vigor_ while they already have it they must choose whether to keep their current amount of _Vigor_ or replace it with the value they would gain.

&nbsp;
### Open and Hidden Information
**Open Information**: Players should <ins>always</ins> have access to the following information, either openly or by asking the Spirit Master:
* The victory condition for the current encounter.
* An approximation of a creature's _Health_ to the closest 25%.
* What _Statuses_ and _Afflictions_ a creature is currently suffering from.
* When/how any _Hazards_ on the battlefield will trigger, and the approximate consequence for doing so (i.e., 'you will be hit by an attack that might inflict _Shock_z).
&nbsp;

**Almost-Open Information:** Players should learn the following information after damaging a creature or afflicting an _Affliction_ or _Bane_:
* If any damage they dealt was _Resisted_.
* If the Target _Negated_ or was Immune to any afflicted _Bane_ or _Affliction_.
* The Target's _Guard_.
&nbsp;

**Hidden Information:** Players should not know the following information unless a _Technique_ reveals it and, additionally, the Spirit Master should not know the following information about player characters unless a _Technique_ reveals it:
* What _Techniques_ a creature is using (before the creature resolves said _Techniques_).
* A creature's exact, current _Health_.
* How many of each _Token_ a creature has.
* The creature's current _Stance_ or _Style_, and what benefits they have.
