### Rounds in Shattered Spirits
Combat in Shattered Spirits is split up into Rounds, Phases, and Turns. A Round is a complete cycle of combat, where each Phase is completed. A Phase is a collection of Turns that are all occurring at a similar speed in combat. A Turn is a specific character's opportunity to act in combat, where they can use various Actions to influence the battle.
&nbsp;
A Round is divided into the following phases:
* **Plotting Phase:** In the Plotting Phase, both the Game Master and the Players will all determine what Actions they are making use of in the round. No Actions resolve during the Plotting Phase; it exists simply for players and the Game Master to decide their Actions for the round. Unlike the other Phases, players and enemies go simultaneously in this Phase. This Phase ends when all players and enemies have decided their Actions for the Round.
* **Instinctive Phase:** The Instinctive Phase is for Actions that are nearly as fast as the speed of thought. It is the first Phase where Actions may be resolved, but typically Actions in this Phase do not provide Movement, and do not target other creatures in a meaningful way.
* **Refresh Phase:** This Phase occurs right before the start of a round. Many Stances and Actions use the Refresh Phase to either grant a creature resources, or as an approximation for the start of a round.
* **Phase 1-6:** These numbered Phases are where the bulk of Actions will be resolved. Phases are resolved in order, 1-6, with Phase 1 representing the fastest Actions and Phase 6 representing the slowest.

&nbsp;
An individual Phase is divided into Turns, where Players and enemies take Actions. Within a Phase, players and enemies will alternate who acts, with the next Phase beginning with the faction opposite of that which acted last in the current Phase. Within a Phase players and enemies decide among themselves who goes when. Typically, players get to act first in the first Instinctive Phase of combat; after that, the first to act in the next Phase is always the opposite of whatever group finished the current Phase. For example, if a player acts last in Phase 2, an enemy gets to act first in Phase 3.
&nbsp;
The Plotting Phase is where a great deal of the decision making in combat will occur. A Player has 3 Action Points or AP that they can divide among Actions as they wish. Players will choose the Actions they wish to use in the Round, then decide which Speed they wish to play them at. In almost every case this is the listed Speed of the Action, although some Stances and Styles permit changes to the Speed of Actions. The exception are Actions with the Set-Up or Follow-Up Speed; rather than being played in a specific Phase, they are attached to another Action that lacks the Set-Up or Follow-Up Speed. These Actions are resolved simultaneously with the Action it is attached to. A Set-Up happens immediately before the Action, while Follow-Up happens immediately after.
&nbsp;
Making more than a single Strike per round is difficult and requires significant Momentum. Using a second Strike in the same Round increases its Cost by 2 Momentum, while a third increases its Cost by 4 Momentum.
&nbsp;
After an Action is selected during the Plotting Phase a character is committing to using that Action. However, if a character finds they no longer wish to use a Action selected in the Plotting Phase, they may choose to Improvise an Action and pay 2 Momentum to replace it with a different Action. This new Action must have the same AP cost and a Speed that is less than or equal to the replaced Action. Some Actions are easier to Improvise, which will be denoted in the Action.

### Making Attacks
In Shattered Spirits there are two types of Attacks: Strikes, and Maneuvers, with slightly different rules for each.
&nbsp;
**Manuevers** are much more limited and typically do not deal any Damage. The Target of a Maneuver is explicitly listed and must target that specific thing.
&nbsp;
**Strikes** are much more flexible and can typically target anything in range. When a creature uses a Strike, they may choose to target any valid targets of an attack.
&nbsp;
Attacks resolve slightly differently against different things, as outlined below.
* <ins>Creature:</ins> Resolve the Attack as its Profile dictates.
* <ins>Obstacle:</ins> Resolve the Attack as its Profile dictates. If it would do Damage equal to or greater than the Obstacles Durability, Destroy it. Otherwise, nothing happens. Inflict no Status unless specifically stated in the Attack.
* <ins>Equipment:</ins> Resolve the Attack as its Profile dictates, at Disadvantage if the piece of Equipment is Worn or Wielded. If it would do Damage equal to or greater than the Equipment's Durability, Damage it. Even if the Equipment is not Damaged, you may pay 1 Momentum on a Hit or Crit to attempt to Disarm that piece of Equipment. The creature may Negate with 1 Reflex or Grit on a Hit, or 2 Reflex or Grit on a Crit. Inflict no Status unless specifically stated in the Attack.
* <ins>Armor:</ins> Resolve the Attack as its Profile dictates at Disadvantage. If it would do Damage equal to or greater than the Armor's Durability plus it's current Armor value inflict Shred 1. Deal half the rolled Damage to the creature wearing the Armor and inflict Status as normal, but reduce the Cost to Negate by 1. 
* <ins>Creature Part:</ins> Resolve the Attack as its Profile dictates. Deal the rolled Damage to the Creature Part. Deal half the rolled Damage to the creature and inflict Status as normal, but reduce the Cost to Negate by 1.
