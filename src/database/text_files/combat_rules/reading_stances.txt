**Stances** represent a character's bearing in combat and tend to allow them to specialize in a specific approach in combat. A character may have one Martial Stance and one Spirit Stance active at the same time. Stances provide an easy way for character to gain combat resources, and tend to empower a specific type of action or playstyle.
&nbsp;
The header of a Stance is fairly sparse; it will only contain the name of the Stance and a brief description of how it functions.
&nbsp;
The meat of a Stance is contained in its body. The following fields can be typically found in a Stance:
* **Requirements:** Most Martial Stances have this field. If a Stance has Requirements, you do not get any benefits from this Stance unless you fulfill them. You can still be using the Stance, but will not get any bonuses or resources from it. For example, if a Stance requires _Wielding_ a Bladed Weapon, if the character is _Disarmed_ of their _Bladed_ Weapon they lose all bonuses provided by said Stance.
* **Accumulate:** This field is present on most Stances, and indicates a way that combat resources can be easily obtained. Typically, the Accumulate field will contain a condition that, if fulfilled, will provide the spiritbound with Momentum or some other combat resource.
* **Refresh:** While the Accumulate field indicates a resource that must be earned, the Refresh field indicates what combat resources a character simply gains for free at the Refresh Phase in combat. These tend to be defensive resources such as Grit and Reflex, but can occasionally include other resources or actions, such as creating Terrain during Refresh.
* **Effect:** This field indicates a passive bonus or additional options available to the character while in this Stance. Reduced Cost or increased effectiveness for certain actions are common, but some Stances have more esoteric bonuses.
* **Special:** This field is similar to Effect, but is usually a secondary bonus or one that breaks a typical rule.
