**Techniques** are every attack, move, and defensive action characters take in combat. Every Action or Reaction in the game is presented on a Technique card and, in aggregate, they represent your character's combat capabilities.
&nbsp;
The header of a Technique card contains a great deal of the bookkeeping information about the action. First is the name of the Technique, followed by a brief description.
&nbsp;
The next line has the <ins>Speed</ins> of the Technique, which will either correspond with a Phase (such as Instinctive or 1-6) or be listed as a Reaction. This is followed by the <ins>Range</ins> of a Technique, which will be Melee (meaning it can only target adjacent foes), Self (meaning it targets the creature using it), or be listed as a numeric value. If the Technique effects an <ins>Area</ins> that is listed next (see the Areas page for more information about the different areas of effect). Finally, the <ins>AP</ins> of the Technique is listed, which is how many Action Points it takes to use. This is typically a value between 1 and 3. If no AP cost is listed, it has no cost and may be used for free.
&nbsp;
Between the body and the header of a Technique there is a colored line that designates the <ins>Type</ins> of the action.
* **<span style="color: darkred">Strike:</span>** A <ins>Strike</ins> is designated by a dark red line. If a Technique has a Chart with a Damage column it is always a Strike.
* **<span style="color: purple">Move:</span>** A <ins>Move</ins> is designated by a purple line. Move Techniques do exactly what they sound like; provide high mobility options.
* **<span style="color: darkgreen">Defensive:</span>** A <ins>Defensive</ins> Technique provides ways to mitigate damage and conditions to enhance survivability.
* **<span style="color: darkblue">Maneuver:</span>** A <ins>Maneuver</ins> is designated by a dark blue line. Maneuvers are the broadest category of Techniques and is a bit of a catch-all, but tend to be low damage and either target the environment or enemies.

&nbsp;
The remainder of the Technique is outlined in the body of the card. Not every field listed here is present in every Technique, but they are all defined here!
* **Cost** is an up-front cost of a Technique that must be paid in the Plotting Phase if it's an Action, or when used if it's a Reaction. If this Cost is not paid, the Technique may not be used.
* **Requirements** are some sort of prerequisite that must be fulfilled before a Technique can be used. This is most commonly found with Weapon Techniques, that require a specific Weapon to be Equipped in order to use the Action. This Requirement does not have to be fulfilled in the Plotting Phase, but does have to be true when the Technique would be used.
* **Trigger** is something relevant for Reactions. All Reactions have a Trigger, which is the condition th at must be fulfilled before the Reaction can be used, such as you being Attacked or a creature moving away from you.
* **Target** is what the Technique is going to actually effect. Typically this is a number of creatures or spaces.
* **Movement** is how far the Technique allows you to move, either None, Step, Reposition, Shift, or Sprint. Refer to your Armor's Movement Chart to see how far each of these Movements allows you to go. If a Reaction allows you to use a Technique you do not use its Movement.
* **Effect** is the primary effect of the Technique. This varies greatly from Technique to Technique, but the Effect box is typically the bulk of what a Technique accomplishes.
* **Special** is a secondary effect of the Technique, that is typically either conditional or more specific than the primary effect.
* **Imbue** is an additional Cost you can pay during the Plotting Phase to increase the effectiveness of a Technique, typically in a way that changes the Speed of the Technique. This additional Cost is purely optional.
* **Boost** is an additional Cost that is paid when a Technique is used to amplify its power. This additional Cost is purely optional, but is typically a significant boost.
* **Reaction** is a special Reaction that, if you play this card in the Planning Phase, you have access to for this _Round_. If a Technique is _Improvised_ you do not gain access to its Reaction.

&nbsp;
The last potential field in a Technique is it's **Profile**. A Profile is what is used to determine the effectiveness of an attack. It is comprised of two or three columns: _Hit_,  Damage, and Status.
* **Hit** shows whether an Attack is a _Miss_,  _Graze_,  _Hit_,  or Crit. This column will always show 2-12, with a color code to show the effectiveness. Red means a _Miss_,  gold means a _Graze_,  green means a _Hit_,  and purple means a Crit. When you Attack, simply consult the _Hit_ column and resolve the Attack using that row.
* **Damage** shows how much damage is dealt by the attack. This is present for all Strikes and some Maneuvers.
* **Status** shows what status conditions this attack may afflict. These will always follow the format Condition X (Y Defense). The Condition is the actual status effect being afflicted, such as Hobbled. X is present if this Technique afflicts a Condition, and designates the size of the Token. Sometimes this will be followed by a x2 or x3, indicating that it applies multiple Tokens of that size. Finally, the Y Defense section designates what must be paid to Negate this status effect. When this Technique is used, the Target may pay Y of the listed Defense to not gain the status effect.
