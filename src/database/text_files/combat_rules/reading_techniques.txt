**Techniques** are every attack, move, and defensive action characters take on their _Turn_ in combat. In aggregate, Techniques represent your character's combat capabilities.
&nbsp;
The header of a Technique card contains a great deal of information. First is the name of the Technique, followed by a brief description.
&nbsp;
The next line has the <ins>Speed</ins> of the Technique, which will either correspond with a Phase (such as Instinctive or 1-6) or be listed as a Reaction. This is followed by the <ins>Range</ins> of a Technique, which will be Melee (meaning it can only target adjacent foes), Self (meaning it targets the creature using it), or be listed as a numeric value. If the Technique effects an <ins>Area</ins> that is listed next (see the Areas page for more information about the different areas of effect). Finally, the <ins>AP</ins> of the Technique is listed, which is how many Action Points it takes to use. This is typically a value between 1 and 3. If no AP cost is listed, it has no cost and may be used for free.
&nbsp;
Following that, all Keywords for the Technique are listed. These can be flags such as _Glancing_ that make the Technique less effective, or something like _Pierce_, which makes it far easier to deal with _Guard_.
&nbsp;
Between the body and the header of a Technique there is a colored line that designates the <ins>Type</ins> of the action.
* **<span style="color: darkblue">General:</span>** A <ins>General</ins> Technique is designated by a blue background and the <img :src="$general" style="height:1em" /> symbol. General Techniques tend to target yourself or the environment, or impact foes in a non-damaging way.
* **<span style="color: darkred">Strike:</span>** A <ins>Strike</ins> Technique is designated by a red background and the <img :src="$strike" style="height:1em" /> symbol. Strike Techniques typically deal high damage and are the main way to damage opponents.
* **<span style="color: purple">Move:</span>**  A <ins>Move</ins> Technique is designated by a purple background and the <img :src="$move" style="height:1em" /> symbol. Move Techniques typically provide a great deal of mobility.
* **<span style="color: gold">Support:</span>** <ins>Support</ins> Techniques are designated by a yellow background and the <img :src="$support" style="height:1em" /> symbol. These Techniques typically target allies, and provide them with valuable resources such as _Momentum_ or _Vigor_ or can allow them to move about during battle.
* **<span style="color: darkgreen">Defensive:</span>** A <ins>Defensive</ins> Technique is designated by a green background and the <img :src="$defensive" style="height:1em" /> symbol. Defensive Techniques typically make using Resist Maneuvers easier or otherwise enhance your ability to survive.

&nbsp;
The remainder of the Technique is outlined in the body of the card. Not every field listed here is present in every Technique; they are simply here for a comprehensive definition.
* **Cost** is an up-front cost of a Technique that must be paid when the Technique is played, typically while _Plotting_.
* **Requirements** are some sort of prerequisite that must be fulfilled before a Technique can be used. 
This Requirement does not have to be fulfilled when it is played, but does have to be true when the Technique would be used.
* **Weapon** is a somewhat specialized requirement; if this Technique references _Weapon Attacks_ they must be made using the Weapon type specified by this field.
* **Target** is what the Technique is going to actually effect. Typically this is a creature, but some Techniques specify that they must target _Obstacles_ or something similar.
* **Movement** is how far the Technique allows you to move, typically either None, _Step_, _Reposition_, or _Dash_. Refer to your Armor's Movement Chart to see how far each of these Movements allows you to go. If a Reaction allows you to use a Technique you do not use its Movement.
* **Effect** is the primary effect of the Technique. This varies greatly from Technique to Technique, but the Effect box is typically the bulk of what a Technique accomplishes.
* **Special** is a secondary effect of the Technique, that is typically either conditional or more specific than the primary effect.
* **Imbue** is an additional Cost you can pay when playing Technique (typically in the Plotting Phase) to increase the effectiveness of a Technique. This often changes the Speed or AP of a Technique, hence why it must be applied when played.
* **Boost** is an additional cost that is paid when a Technique is used to amplify its power. This additional cost is purely optional, but can have a massive impact on the effectiveness of a Technique.

The last potential field in a Technique is it's **Profile**, discussed below.
