**Techniques** are every attack, move, and defensive action characters take on their _Turn_ in combat. In aggregate, Techniques represent your character's combat capabilities.
&nbsp;
The header of a Technique card contains a great deal of information. First is the name of the Technique, followed by a brief description.
&nbsp;
The next line has the <ins>Speed</ins> of the Technique, which will either correspond with a Phase (such as Instinctive or 1-6) or be listed as a Reaction. This is followed by the <ins>Range</ins> of a Technique, which will be Melee (meaning it can only target adjacent foes), Self (meaning it targets the creature using it), or be listed as a numeric value. If the Technique effects an <ins>Area</ins> that is listed next (see the Areas page for more information about the different areas of effect). Finally, the <ins>AP</ins> of the Technique is listed, which is how many Action Points it takes to use. This is typically a value between 1 and 3. If no AP cost is listed, it has no cost and may be used for free.
&nbsp;
Following that, all Keywords for the Technique are listed. These can be flags such as _Glancing_ that make the Technique less effective, or something like _Pierce_, which makes it far easier to deal with _Guard_.
&nbsp;
Between the body and the header of a Technique there is a colored line that designates the <ins>Type</ins> of the action.
* **<span style="color: darkred">Strike:</span>** A <ins>Strike</ins> is designated by a dark red line. If a Technique has a Chart with a Damage column it is always a Strike.
* **<span style="color: purple">Move:</span>** A <ins>Move</ins> is designated by a purple line. Move Techniques do exactly what they sound like; provide high mobility options.
* **<span style="color: gold">Support:</span>** <ins>Support</ins> Techniques are designated by a yellow line. These Techniques typically target allies, and provide them with valuable resources such as _Momentum_ or _Vigor_ or can allow them to move about during battle.
* **<span style="color: darkblue">Maneuver:</span>** A <ins>Maneuver</ins> is designated by a dark blue line. Maneuvers are the broadest category of Techniques and is a bit of a catch-all, but tend to be low damage and either target the environment or enemies.

&nbsp;
The remainder of the Technique is outlined in the body of the card. Not every field listed here is present in every Technique; they are simply here for a comprehensive definition.
* **Cost** is an up-front cost of a Technique that must be paid when the Technique is played, typically while _Plotting_.
* **Requirements** are some sort of prerequisite that must be fulfilled before a Technique can be used. This is most commonly found with Weapon Techniques that require a specific Weapon to be _Wielded_ in order to use the Technique. This Requirement does not have to be fulfilled when it is played, but does have to be true when the Technique would be used.
* **Target** is what the Technique is going to actually effect. Typically this is a creature, but some Techniques specify that they must target _Obstacles_ or something similar.
* **Movement** is how far the Technique allows you to move, typically either None, _Step_, _Reposition_, _Dash_, or _Sprint_. Refer to your Armor's Movement Chart to see how far each of these Movements allows you to go. If a Reaction allows you to use a Technique you do not use its Movement.
* **Effect** is the primary effect of the Technique. This varies greatly from Technique to Technique, but the Effect box is typically the bulk of what a Technique accomplishes.
* **Special** is a secondary effect of the Technique, that is typically either conditional or more specific than the primary effect.
* **Imbue** is an additional Cost you can pay during the Plotting Phase to increase the effectiveness of a Technique, typically in a way that changes the Speed or AP cost of the Technique. This additional Cost is purely optional, but must be selected when the card is played.
* **Boost** is an additional Cost that is paid when a Technique is used to amplify its power. This additional Cost is purely optional, but can have a massive impact on the effectiveness of a Technique.
* **Reaction** is a special Reaction that, typically after playing the Reaction, you have access to for the rest of the _Round_, or the duration specified in the Technique.
* **Enhance** denotes a special way that a card may be used. Rather than being played independently as a Technique, this may be used to upgrade a different Technique by paying the cost listed in its Enhancement description. Add all listed effects to the Technique. You may use as many Enhancements on a single card as you wish, but must be able to pay all costs and follow the requirements of the Enhancement. In addition, an Enhancement granted by a Technique may not be used on that Technique.

Both **Reactions** and **Enhancements** are more thoroughly explained below.

The last potential field in a Technique is it's **Profile**, discussed below.
