### Conditions
A Condition is a brief, temporary affliction gained in combat that is tracked through Tokens. Each Token has a value ranging from 1 to 3, which represents the severity of the current condition. Whenever a character gains a Token, they place it on top of the next Token with the same numeric value (in effect keeping their Tokens sorted, with the highest on top). During a character's turn they suffer an effect based on the topmost Token for each Condition. Condition Tokens are typically removed after they activate once.
