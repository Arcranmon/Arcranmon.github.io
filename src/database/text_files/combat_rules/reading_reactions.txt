**Reactions** are ways that creatures can influence a combat encounter even when it is not their _Turn_. They are used to move, defend, attack, and every action in between. Characters may use a single _Reaction_ every Turn. For the purpose of this limit a _Phase_ beginning counts as a special _Turn_ where only _Reactions_ resolve.

The header of a Reaction will simply contain its name, a brief description, and any applicable Keywords that the Reaction has.

The remainder of the Reaction is outlined in the body of the card. Not every field listed here is present in every Reaction; they are simply here for a comprehensive definition.
* **Cost** is what must be paid when a Reaction is used. If the cost cannot be paid, the Reaction may not be used.
* **Requirements** are any condition that must be true to use a Reaction. These are most commonly that you have used a specific Technique this _Round_, or are in a particular _Stance_/_Style_.
* **Trigger** defines what must occur to use a Reaction. Common examples are 'You are attacked' or 'A _Phase_ begins.'
* **Move** is a fairly rare field for Reactions, but works identically to Techniques; you simply move this distances. <ins>If Move is not present on a Reaction you may not Move, even if it allows you to use a Technique that normally Movement.</ins>
* **Effect** is the primary effect of the Reaction.
* **Boost** is an additional Cost that is paid when a Reaction is used to amplify its power. This additional Cost is purely optional, but can have a massive impact on the effectiveness of a Reaction.
