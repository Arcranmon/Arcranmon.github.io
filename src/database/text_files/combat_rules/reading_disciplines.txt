### Reading Disciplines
Disciplines are where much of a characters combat abilities come from and are how characters gain access to Stances, Techniques, and Maneuvers.
&nbsp;
Disciplines are separated into several Tiers. A character may only take a higher Tier of a Discipline if they have the previous Tier, and may not select Tier III Disciplines until [not Level 1].
&nbsp;
Disciplines are labeled with a role that generally describes the types of abilities provided. The first listed role is typically a common thread throughout most Techniques and Maneuvers and is the main purpose of the Stance, while the second role may only appear in some. The different roles are as follows:

* **Artillery** Disciplines specialize in long-range and prefer to keep their distance from foes. Artillery Disciplines are typically capable of high damage at long ranges but can struggle with Cover and other obstructions.
* **Controller** Disciplines specialize in applying status afflictions to foes and moving them about the battlefield, limiting their effectiveness and making foes easier targets for allies.
* **Courier** Disciplines tend to have high movement among their abilities, as well as movement options that make it far easier to navigate terrain and enemy positions.
* **Defender** Disciplines specialize in drawing fire from enemies and keeping them nearby, controlling enemies by limiting their targeting options.
* **Shaper** Disciplines heavily manipulate Terrain and Features, either by creating them or removing them and can easily change the layout of the battlefield.
* **Striker** Disciplines specialize in close-range combat, and often prioritize melee attacks over all else. Striker Disciplines are typically capable of the greatest damage in the system.
* **Supporter** Disciplines are often able to provide allies with Defensive Tokens or Momentum, as well as repositioning them, removing harmful effects, or otherwise assisting allies.
* **Survivor** Disciplines tend to provide powerful Resists that allow characters to mitigate damage and other effects to remain in the battle longer.

&nbsp;
When selecting Disciplines, be mindful of any common prerequisites among their Techniques; if you select a Discipline that requires a Bladed Weapon and aren't carrying one, it isn't going to be of much use! Additionally, if you intend to heavily focus on Defender Disciplines, selecting some Survivor Disciplines will be essential to keeping yourself in the battle.
