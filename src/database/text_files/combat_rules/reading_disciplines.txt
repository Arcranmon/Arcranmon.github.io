### Reading Disciplines
A **Discipline** is a collection of Stances, Styles, and Techniques that encompasses a method of combat. Skill Disciplines represent a character's physical capabilities and expertise with their equipment, while Spirit Disciplines represent the different ways that a character can make use of their spirit's power.
&nbsp;
A Discipline is comprised of Styles (in the case of a Skill Discipline), Stances (in the case of a Spirit Discipline), and Techniques, all of which will be elaborated on later. In addition, a Discipline includes a short description of how it works and some of the background behind the Discipline, as well as a Role designation. A Role attempts to describe how a Discipline plays and their typical abilities in combat. The potential roles are as follows:
&nbsp;
* **Architects** manipulate the shape and structure of the battlefield. By creating, destroying, or moving Terrain and Obstacles Architect Disciplines reshape the field on the fly.
* **Artillery** focus on long-range damaging Strikes. Artillery Disciplines tend to have low mobility, but can deal heavy damage to foes that are not in Cover.
* **Controllers**, true to their name, control and hinder foes through movement-based abilities such as Pushes and Pulls, as well as harmful status conditions like Hobbled and Exposed.
* **Defenders** tend to have a mix of abilities that make them more survivable, as well as abilities that encourage foes to target them, drawing attacks away from their allies.
* **Couriers** are the premiere movement-based Discipline and have a wide range of abilities to move themselves across the battlefield with minimal difficulty.
* **Strikers** specialize in close-range damage. They prefer to be in the front-lines of an encounter, but can deal more consistent damage than Artillery as a result.
* **Supporters** primarily have abilities that target allies, either repositioning them, providing them combat resources, or healing and removing harmful status effects.

&nbsp;
Roles simply exist to attempt to broadly categorize Disciplines and are descriptive, not prescriptive. Many Disciplines will have two Roles listed; in this case, a single Role does not define the Discipline well as it sits somewhere between the two Roles.
