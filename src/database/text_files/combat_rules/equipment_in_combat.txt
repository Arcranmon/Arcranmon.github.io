### Equipment in Combat
In combat, characters' equipment is defined by what they have _Equipped_ and what they have _Wielded_.
&nbsp;

_Equipped_ items are simply anything that a character is wearing. If it is in their inventory, it is typically considered _Equipped_. A character's _Armor_, any consumable items, and any _Weapons_ stowed on their belt are common examples of _Equipped_ items.
&nbsp;

_Wielded_ items, on the other hand, are items that characters actively are using, typically by holding it in a hand. One-Handed items require a single hand to _Wield_, while Two-Handed items require both.
&nbsp;

If a character does not have an item _Wielded_ in a hand, that hand is considered an _Open Hand_.
&nbsp;

**Two-Handed Equipment and Open Hands:** Generally, Two-Handed equipment can be held in a single hand while _Wielded_ but not being used. A character may have a single _Open Hand_ while wielding a _Two-Handed_ piece of equipment, but may not use the equipment while using said _Open Hand_.
