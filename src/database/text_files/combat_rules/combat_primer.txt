Combat in Shattered Spirits is a mix of carefully planned abilities and sudden, spur-of-the-moment decision making. Every _Round_ begins with a _Respite_, where combatants gain resources, reset their defenses, and, depending on their abilities, may be able to accomplish some minor actions.

&nbsp;

After _Respite_ is complete, _Plotting_ begins. All combatants decide which of their _Techniques_ they are going to use for the _Round_, as well as what _Phase_ (a value ranging from 1-8) it will be played in. Faster _Techniques_ tend to have a more minimal impact, while slower _Techniques_ will have more power, but run the risk of being invalidated by how the battlefield shifts over time. Players should collaborate when picking _Techniques_ and can effectively use this period to plan their approach for the _Round_. _Techniques_ all specify what _Phases_ it can be played at, as outlined by their Speed.

&nbsp;

Once all combatants have selected their _Techniques_ and when they will be played it becomes public knowledge what creature is using a _Technique_ in what _Phase_, but not what exact _Technique_ is being used. Players (as well as enemies!) can use this information to adapt their plans accordingly.

&nbsp;

At this point the round of combat begins, starting in _Phase_ 1. Players and enemies alternate acting, resolving _Techniques_ and other abilities until a _Phase_ is complete and the next begins. Once _Phase_ 8 is over things loop back over the _Respite_ and the next _Round_ begins!

&nbsp;

Aside from their _Technique_, players can also contribute to the battle using _Actions_, which typical cost _Action Points_ or _AP_, a small resource pool that refreshes every _Round_. Some _Actions_, such as _Fight_, are a simple way to deal more damage, while _Shift_ is an excellent way to maneuver around the battlefield. Characters can use an _Action_ whenever it is their chance to act in combat, but may only use a single _Action_ or _Technique_ in a given _Phase_.

&nbsp;

Beyond _Actions_ and _Techniques_, characters have a host of other abilities they can use in battle:
* _Attacks_ are abilities that focus on defeating foes. These can only be used when specifically outlined (such as by a _Technique_ or _Stunt_), but may be used at any Speed! Be forewarned though; using an Attack in a _Phase_ lower than it's _Speed_ imposes a steep penalty on its accuracy. If using a _Technique_ that allows you to make Attacks, consider playing it in a _Phase_ that will mitigate those  penalties! Attacks are split into Major and Minor Attacks; Minor Attacks can be used easily at low cost, but Major Attacks are more effective!
* _Stunts_ are special abilities that characters can use on their _Turn_. These are abilities like _Sprint_, which allows you to move further, or _Leap_ which can let you jump over dangerous obstacles.
* _Reactions_ are abilities that can be used at any time. These are powerful defensive abilities like _Active Defense_, as well as things that allow you to punish foes, such as _Flank_.
* _Gambits_ are specialized abilities that enhance Attacks. These can be applied at any time (even after rolling!), and typically enhance the effect of an attack.

&nbsp;

In combat there are a few main resources that a character must manage:
* _Momentum_ is a character's primary mechanism for doing more in combat. Most _Stunts_, _Reactions_, _Gambits_, and many Attacks cost _Momentum_. _Momentum_ is gained from your _Stances_ during _Respite_, by abilities such as _Focus_, and by missing Attacks.
* _Stamina_ is a character's primary defensive resource, which can be spent to avoid status effects and other debilitating conditions.
* _Health_ is a measure of a character's current endurance in combat. If a character's _Health_ hits 0 they aren't immediately defeated; instead, they gain _Wounds_ which make continuing combat more difficult.
* _Vigor_ is a pool of pseudo-Health that is always lost prior to _Health_. _Vigor_ never stacks; a character must either gain nothing or replace their current value when they would gain _Vigor_.
* _AP_ is a special resource typically used to fuel _Actions_. Characters typically get 2 of this a _Round_.
* Finally, each _Round_ characters may use a single powerful _Manifest_ ability, where they give their spirit physical form and summon them to the battlefield. This ability typically has no cost and can be used in a _Round_ where you've already used an _Action_/_Technique_. All characters have access to _Swift Manifestation_, which allows you to upgrade a _Minor Attack_ into a _Major Attack_, _Spiritual Interdiction_, which causes their spirit to take a hit meant for them, and _Spirit Summon_, which brings your spirit onto the field for an extended time.

&nbsp;

Finally, characters need to carefully manage their _Sources_ and ensure that they don't fall victim to a condition that makes it difficult to use their spirit powers! 
* Flame abilities are _Suppressed_ when the user is _Soaked_ and _Sealed_ when the user is _Swimming_.
* Earth abilities are _Suppressed_ when the user is not within 2 spaces of a _Source_, and _Sealed_ when there is no _Source_ within 5 spaces or the user is _Flying_.
* Water abilities are _Suppressed_ when the user is _Alight_. Water Abilities are _Sealed_ if there is no _Source_ within 10 spaces.
* Wind abilities are _Suppressed_ when the user is underground and _Sealed_ when the user is fully encased in _Earth_, such as when _Restrained_ by an _Earth_ Ability.

&nbsp;

Combat typically continues until the players succeed or fail their objective for the battle. This can be something as simple as defeating all their enemies or more complicated, such as holding specific objectives on the battlefield for a set duration. Your Spirit Master will explain how to win at the beginning of combat, as well as answer any rules questions that you may have during the battle. Good luck, and may you and your spirit find success on the battlefield!
