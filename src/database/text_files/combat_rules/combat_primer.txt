Combat in Shattered Spirits is a mix of carefully planned abilities and sudden, spur-of-the-moment decision making. Every _Round_ begins with a _Respite_, where combatants gain resources, reset their defenses, and, depending on their abilities, may be able to accomplish some minor actions.

&nbsp;

After _Respite_ is complete, _Plotting_ begins. All combatants decide which of their _Techniques_ they are going to use for the _Round_, as well as what _Phase_ (a value ranging from 1-4) it will be played in. Faster _Techniques_ tend to have a more minimal impact, while slower _Techniques_ will have more power, but run the risk of being invalidated by how the battlefield shifts over time. Players should collaborate when picking _Techniques_ and can effectively use this period to plan their approach for the _Round_. _Techniques_ all specify what _Phases_ it can be played at, as outlined by their Speed.

&nbsp;

Once all combatants have selected their _Techniques_ and when they will be played it becomes public knowledge what creature is using a _Technique_ in what _Phase_, but not what _Technique_ is being used. Players (as well as enemies!) can use this information to adapt their plans accordingly.

&nbsp;

At this point the round of combat begins, starting in _Phase_ 1. Players and enemies alternate acting, resolving _Techniques_ and other abilities until a _Phase_ is complete and the next begins. Once _Phase_ 4 is over _Respite_ starts and the next _Round_ begins!

&nbsp;

Aside from their _Technique_, players can also contribute to the battle using _Actions_. Characters may use an _Action_ in every _Phase_ that they are not using their _Technique_. Some _Actions_, such as _Fight_, are a simple way to deal more damage, while _Reposition_ is an excellent way to maneuver around the battlefield.

&nbsp;

Beyond _Actions_ and _Techniques_, characters have a host of other abilities they can use in battle:
* _Attacks_ are abilities that focus on defeating or debuffing foes. These can only be used when specifically outlined (such as by a _Technique_ or _Stunt_), but may be used at any Speed! Be forewarned though; using an Attack in a _Phase_ lower than it's _Speed_ imposes a steep penalty on its accuracy. If using a _Technique_ that allows you to make Attacks, consider playing it in a _Phase_ that will mitigate those  penalties! Attacks are split into _Light_, _Balanced_, and _Heavy_ Attacks. Each tier of Attack is more effective than the last, but tends to cost more _Momentum_ to use.
* _Stunts_ are special abilities that characters can use on their _Turn_. These are abilities like _Sprint_, which allows you to move further, or _Leap_ which can let you jump over dangerous features.
* _Reactions_ are abilities that can be used at any time. These are powerful defensive abilities like _Defend_, as well as things that allow you to punish foes, such as _Opportunity Attack_.
* _Gambits_ are specialized abilities that enhance Attacks. Whenever a character rolls doubles or rolls a _Critical Hit_ they may apply a _Gambit_, or apply two if both conditions are true.

&nbsp;

In combat there are a few main resources that a character must manage:
* _Momentum_ is a character's primary mechanism for doing more in combat. Most _Stunts_, _Reactions_, _Gambits_, and many Attacks cost _Momentum_. _Momentum_ is gained from your _Stances_ during _Respite_, by abilities such as _Focus_, and by missing Attacks.
* _Movement_ is used by characters to traverse the battlefield and fuel high-mobility abilities. Characters have a small pool of _Movement_ that they may spend whenever it is their _Turn_. Additionally, many _Techniques_ and _Actions_ will provide additional _Movement_ that a character may use.
* _Stamina_ is a character's primary defensive resource, which can be spent to fuel defensive Reactions and ensure a character's survival.
* _Health_ is a measure of a character's current endurance in combat. If a character's _Health_ hits 0 they aren't immediately defeated; instead, they gain _Wounds_ which make continuing combat more difficult.
* _Vigor_ is a pool of pseudo-Health that is always lost prior to _Health_. _Vigor_ never stacks; a character must either gain nothing or replace their current value when they would gain _Vigor_.

&nbsp;

Shattered Spirits uses a zone-based combat system where rather than a battlemap consisting of hexes or spaces there are simply different areas, called Arenas, where combatants can be. Each _Arena_ represents a distinct environment in the battlefield with its own terrain and hazards.

&nbsp;

Within each _Arena_ are a number of _Positions_, which represent the approximate positioning of characters and objects within said _Arena_. Most _Arenas_ can have any number of _Positions_, and it typically takes only a single _Movement_ to move between _Positions_.

&nbsp;

The avenues between _Arenas_ are called _Paths_ and represent the distance and hazards in between different _Arenas_. It always takes at least one _Movement_ to move between _Arenas_, although it typically costs more due to environmental effects.

&nbsp;

Range is based on the number of _Arenas_. _Melee_ effects can be used at your _Position_, while _Short_ Range may target anything in your _Arena_ that is not at your _Position_. _Reach_ Range may target any creature within your _Arena_. _Medium_ Range may target within an adjacent _Arena_, and _Long_ Range may target two _Arenas_ away. Effects may ONLY use their listed Range; a _Short_ Range effect could not target something at your _Position_, for example.

&nbsp;

Finally, characters need to carefully manage their _Sources_ and ensure that they don't fall victim to a condition that makes it difficult to use their spirit powers! 
* Flamebound act as _Suppressed_ when _Soaked_ or at a _Position_ with _Water_ _Terrain_, and _Sealed_ when _Swimming_ in Water.
* Earthbound act as _Suppressed_ when the user has no _Source_ at their _Position_, and _Sealed_ when there is no _Source_ in their _Arena_ or the user is _Flying_.
* Waterbound act as _Suppressed_ when the user is _Alight_, and _Sealed_ if there is no _Source_ in any adjacent _Area_.
* Windbound act as _Suppressed_ when the user is underground and _Sealed_ when the user is fully encased in _Earth_, such as when _Restrained_ by an _Earth_ Ability.

&nbsp;

Combat typically continues until the players succeed or fail their objective for the battle. This can be something as simple as defeating all their enemies or more complicated, such as holding specific objectives on the battlefield for a set duration. Your Spirit Master will explain how to win at the beginning of combat, as well as answer any rules questions that you may have during the battle. Good luck, and may you and your spirit find success on the battlefield!
