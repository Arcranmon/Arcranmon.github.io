**Maneuvers** are ways that creatures can improve a Technique and increase its power. 

The header of a Maneuver will simply contain its name, a brief description, and any applicable Keywords that the Reaction has. One particular keyword of note is _Flexible_; typically, Maneuvers must be applied at the same time that a Technique is played. For _Flexible_ Techniques, the Maneuver may be applied when the Technique is used.

The remainder of the Maneuver is outlined in the body of the card. Not every field listed here is present in every Reaction; they are simply here for a comprehensive definition.
* **Cost** is what must be paid when a Maneuver is applied to a Technique. If the cost cannot be paid, the Maneuver may not be used.
* **Requirements** are any condition that must be true to use a Maneuver. Typically, this just requires that you are in a particular _Stance_/_Style_.
* **Effect** is the primary effect of the Maneuver.
* **Special** is the secondary effect of the Maneuver, that is typically either conditional or more specific than the primary effect.
* **Boost** is an additional Cost that can be paid when the Technique this Maneuver has been applied to is used. This additional cost is purely optional, but can have a massive impact on the effectiveness of an Maneuver.
