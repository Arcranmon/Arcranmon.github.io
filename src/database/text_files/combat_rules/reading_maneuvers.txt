**Maneuvers** are ways that creatures can improve a Technique and increase its power. There are several types of **Maneuvers**, which are categorized based on how often they can be used and the common triggers for that Maneuver.

&nbsp;
* **Stratagems** are Maneuvers that characters use when they play a Technique. These Maneuvers typically enhance the power of a Technique while manipulating its Speed in some way. Characters may apply as many Stratagems as they wish to a single Technique.
* **Stunts** are Maneuvers that characters can use on their own Turn. A character may use as many Stuntsas they wish in a given Turn but may only use a given Stunt once unless it has the _Repeatable_ keyword.
* **Resists** are Maneuvers used in response to being assaulted in some way, typically by dodging, blocking, or countering. Characters may only use a single Resist per Turn.
* **Reactions** are Maneuvers used in response to a specific trigger. They can be used at any point, but only once in response to a specific trigger.
* **Gambits** are specialized ways to enhance an Attack that may be applied when the Attack is made. Any number of Gambits may be applied to a specific Attack, but only one with the _Edge_ keyword.
* **Flourishes** are Maneuvers used at the completion of an Attack. Only one Flourish may be used each Turn.
* **Punishes** are specialized Maneuvers used in response to a specific trigger such as a foe moving. A character may use only a single Punish each Turn.

The header of a Maneuver will simply contain its name, a brief description, and any applicable Keywords that the Reaction has. One particular keyword of note is _Flexible_; typically, Maneuvers must be applied at the same time that a Technique is played. For _Flexible_ Techniques, the Maneuver may be applied when the Technique is used.

The remainder of the Maneuver is outlined in the body of the card. Not every field listed here is present in every Reaction; they are simply here for a comprehensive definition.
* **Cost** is what must be paid when a Maneuver is used. If the cost cannot be paid, the Maneuver may not be used.
* **Trigger** defines what must occur to use a Maneuver. Common examples are 'You are attacked' or 'A _Phase_ begins.'
* **Requirements** are any condition that must be true to use a Maneuver. Typically, this just requires that you are in a particular _Stance_.
* **Weapon** is a somewhat specialized requirement; if this Maneuver references _Weapon Attacks_ they must be made using the Weapon type specified by this field.
* **Effect** is the primary effect of the Maneuver.
* **Special** is the secondary effect of the Maneuver, that is typically either conditional or more specific than the primary effect.
* **Boost** is an additional Cost that can be paid when the Technique this Maneuver has been applied to is used. This additional cost is purely optional, but can have a massive impact on the effectiveness of an Maneuver.
