**Stances and Styles** represent a character's bearing in combat and tend to allow them to specialize in a specific approach in combat. Stances come from Spirit Disciplines while Styles come from Skill Disciplines, and a character may have both a Stance and a Style active at the same time. Stances and Styles provide an easy way for character to gain combat resources, and tend to empower a specific type of action or playstyle.
&nbsp;
The header of a Stance or Style is fairly sparse; it will only contain the name of the Stance or Style and a brief description of how it functions in the world.
&nbsp;
The meat of a Stance or Style is contained in its body. The following fields can be typically found in a Stance or Style:
* **Requirements:** Most Styles have this field. If a Stance or Style has Requirements, you do not get any benefits from this Stance or Style unless you fulfill them. You can still be using the Stance or Style, but will not get any bonuses or resources from it. For example, if a Style requires _Wielding_ a Blade Weapon, if the character is _Disarmed_ of their _Blade_ Weapon they lose all bonuses provided by said Style.
* **Accumulate:** This field is present on most Stances and Styles, and indicates a way that combat resources can be easily obtained. Typically, the Accumulate field will contain a condition that, if fulfilled, will provide the spiritbound with Momentum or some other combat resource.
* **Refresh:** While the Accumulate field indicates a resource that must be earned, the Refresh field indicates what combat resources a character simply gains for free at the Refresh Phase in combat. These tend to be defensive resources such as Grit and Reflex, but can occasionally include other resources or actions, such as creating Terrain during Refresh.
* **Effect:** This field indicates a passive bonus or additional options available to the character while in this Stance or Style. Reduced Cost or increased effectiveness for certain actions are common, but some Stances and Styles have more esoteric bonuses.
* **Special:** This field is similar to Effect, but is usually a secondary bonus or one that breaks a typical rule.
* **Enhancement or Reaction:** Most Stances and Styles grant an Enhancement or Reaction; typically, while in this Stance, a character may use that Enhancement or Reaction. These are powerful abilities that allow a character to influence actions or the battlefield even when it isn't their turn.
