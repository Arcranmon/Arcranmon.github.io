Status Effects are commonly inflicted by Attacks and other Actions. A Status Effect persists for the duration specified in the Status or for the duration specified in the inflicting Action or effect, prioritizing the Action in case of a conflict.

If a character already has a Status Effect and gains it from another source nothing happens unless specified by the specific Status, such as Stagger.
