A spiritbound's choice in armor will dictate whether they are an agile, mobile combatant or an indestructible object.  As a general rule:
* Characters that choose No _Armor_ will have exceptional mobility, especially with their ability to _Jump_ greater distances than most characters. They also have access to powerful _Evade_ Reactions that allow them to stay out of harm's way. In exchange, No _Armor_ never provides innate _Guard_.
* Characters that choose Light _Armor_ strike a balance between mobility and defense. They receive some _Guard_ and adequate Movement, but excel at neither. Characters that focus on Light _Armor_ can easily find ways to convert _Momentum_ to _Grit_/_Reflex_, allowing easy access to both _Evade_ and _Block_ Reactions, and often have superior _Punish_ Reaction options.
* Characters that choose Heavy _Armor_ have exceptional _Guard_ compared to other _Armors_, but limited mobility, especially in their ability to _Jump_. A character in Heavy _Armor_ will stay in the fight far longer than their peers, but may struggle with dangerous attacks that require mobility to avoid, such as those that create _Hazards_.
