A spiritbound's choice in armor will dictate whether they are an agile, mobile combatant or an indestructible object. The heavier an armor is, the more _Guard_ a character will have but the more their mobility will be limited, particularly with Actions that only provide _Step_ Movement. Disciplines that focus on the lighter armors tend to emphasize mobility and evasion, while the heavier armors emphasize stability and blocking. A character may choose a single type of armor, ignoring shields for the moment.
