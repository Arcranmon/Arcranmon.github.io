### Choosing Your Spirit
The first, and possibly most important decision that you make as a spiritbound is what type of spirit you are bound to. As far back as any can remember in the world of Deskar, a child's 10th birthday has always been marked by a vivid dream. The specifics vary from person to person, but universally several young spirits are encountered in the dreamscape and, when the child awakes, one is bound to them forevermore. From that day forward the spirit and child are constant companions, lending each other their strength to overcome any feature in their path.
&nbsp;
In general, a spiritbound and their spirit share a body, living in peaceful harmony. However, when either party wishes it, the spirit can assume a diminutive physical form, the appearance of which varies. This is often a side-effect of a spiritbound making use of their powers, although many simply summon their spirit for the company. In times of great danger spirits have been known to *awaken*, an experience where they assume a larger, more powerful form, often at great expense to both the spiritbound and the spirit itself.
&nbsp;
There are six common types of spirits within Deskar, all with their own selection of powers to choose from. A spiritbound can only ever be bound to a singular spirit, so choose wisely!

- **Earth Spirits** are associated with strength, stability, and courage. Earth spirits can manipulate earth and stone, greatly enhance their physical strength, inspire courage in others, and read the subtle motions of the earth to 'see' at great distances. Earth spirits tend to take forms reminiscent of great beasts of burden that are renowned for their strength as well as animals that burrow. They tend to be a bit slower to act when compared with other spirits but are nearly impossible to stop when they decide on a course of action.
- **Flame Spirits** are associated with power, volatility, and rage. Manipulation of fire and heat are the most common powers displayed by Flame spirits, but they also are capable of greatly enhancing their spiritbound's physical performance, albeit with painful repercussions, fan the flames of rage in themselves and others, and even catch brief glimpses of the future in flames. Flame spirits nearly exclusively take the form of predatory animals, especially ones known for hunting in a pack. Flame spirits are commonly regarded as dangerous to interact with as they are easily offended and quick to take revenge, but those that have dealt with them know that they are just as fiercely loyal to their friends.
- **Metal Spirits** are associated with Health, progress, and determination. Of all the elements, metal is the most resistant to change but, despite this, Metalbound are able to magnetically control it, enhance its strength and other properties as well as channel it inwards for impossible Health, use it to dampen the senses of foes, or send a crushing wave of despair outward. Metal spirits tend to be smaller in stature than the other elements, and commonly take the form of insects and other armored creatures. Metal Spirits have only become somewhat common since the Sundering, and in this time mankind has found them to be a stalwart ally, if a bit alien in nature compared to the other spirits.
- **Water Spirits** are associated with fluidity, peace, and adaptability. Water spirits can control water and ice as if it was an extension of their own form, but are also able to exert limited control over the blood of living things, primarily for healing purposes, create an aura of calm, and see into the past to a limited degree. These spirits often take the form of aquatic and amphibious creatures, although it is common for a Water spirit to not have a truly defined form. Water spirits are known for being slow to anger, but also for their long memories. In this new age, people have found river spirits to be one of their most consistent allies, although they bring swift retaliation if disrespected.
- **Wind Spirits** are associated with freedom, change, and speed. These spirits can conjure powerful winds and sudden lightning storms, but can also enhance the speed and reactions of their spiritbound, invoke a deep, primal fear in foes, and feel the movement of the wind for unparalleled awareness. Wind spirits commonly take the form of creatures capable of flight or those known for their speed but, like Water spirits, tend to be a bit more ephemeral in form. Wind spirits are unpredictable by nature and it takes a clever and wise spiritbound to deal with them. Despite their unpredictability, they are rarely truly malicious except in the most extreme of circumstances.
- **Wood Spirits** are associated with the wilderness, tradition, and growth. Wood spirits are able to control their namesake, but can also urge plants to grow, transfer life between living things, create powerful feelings of joy, and sense the emotions of those near them. Wood spirits commonly take small mammalian forms, with a preference for vaguely humanoid ones. Wood spirits are commonly regarded as mischievous and often play pranks, even upon their spiritbound. These pranks range from harmless to potentially lethal, causing most to approach wood spirits with an air of caution.
