### Choosing Your Disciplines
A spiritbound's Disciplines reflect how the character is expecting to act in combat, granting Stances and Techniques that they can use to influence the battlefield.
&nbsp;
To start, select one Martial Discipline and one Spirit Discipline to place at Rank 2 to ensure you have access to both a Martial and Spirit Stance. Stances are vital for generating the resources you will use in combat and can provide powerful passive effects that shape your playstyle. For your Martial Discipline, it's suggested that you select something that aligns with the Weapons and Armor you chose in the previous step. For the Spirit Discipline, simply pick something that will grant you magic that you find interesting!
&nbsp;
Next, distribute four Ranks among other Disciplines as you wish, but you may not increase any Discipline to Rank 3. The same recommendations as above hold true here. If you're unsure what to select, make sure that you have a Rank 1 Discipline for your Weapon, one for your Armor, and distribute the other two among Spirit Disciplines.
