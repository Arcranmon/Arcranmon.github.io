### Choosing Your Disciplines
A spiritbound's Disciplines reflect how the character is expecting to act in combat, granting Stances and Techniques that they can use to influence the battlefield.
&nbsp;
To start, select one Martial Discipline and one Spirit Discipline to place at Rank 2 to ensure you have access to both a Martial and Spirit Stance. Stances are vital for generating the resources you will use in combat and can provide powerful passive effects that shape your playstyle. For your Martial Discipline, select one that matches the playstyle you wish to use. If you want to be a tank, for example, selecting a Defender role is essential! For the Spirit Discipline, simply pick something that will grant you magic that you find interesting!
&nbsp;
To start, you Spirit Discipline must match what you picked for your Spirit when you selected it! For example, if your Spirit is an Earthen Land Spirit, you *must* pick a Land Discipline.
