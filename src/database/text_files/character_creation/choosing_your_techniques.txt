### Choosing Your Techniques
A spiritbound's Techniques are the actions and that characters make use of in combat, and are the core of what happens on a turn.
&nbsp;
You may select six Techniques from the various Skill Masteries and Spirit Masteries available to your Spirit, distributed as you wish. If a Technique has requirements, ensure that you can actually make use of it before selecting it. In general, Techniques will tend to synergize with Stances and Styles from their respective Disciplines, but you can mix and match as you see fit!
&nbsp;
In addition to the Techniques you select, all characters always have access to all Techniques in the 'Basic Skills' section.
