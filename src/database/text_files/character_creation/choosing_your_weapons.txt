The next choice is the type of weapons that a character will wield. In combat, a character can wield up to two hands worth of weaponry at a time. There are many different weapon types, all with their own perks:
* **Bladed** weapons such as swords and daggers tend to be faster, and provide a balanced approach between mobility and defense. Most bladed weapons inflict _Bleeding_, which can slowly take down a foe over time. Bladed weapons tend to have a higher variance in damage than the other types of weapons and can provide the opportunity for massive damage when attacking at Advantage.
* **Hafted** weapons such as hammers and axes tend to be slow but powerful weapons that excel at punching through blocks and armor. They can frequently inflict _Exposed_ or _Push_ foes, allowing them to set up powerful combinations with allies. Hafted weapons tend to have a fairly flat damage profile, making them extremely consistent and making _Ward_ Reactions less effective.
* **Pole** weapons such as spears and pikes boast higher reach and accuracy than other weapon types. Pole weapons tend to inflict _Hobbled_, which limits the mobility of foes, and have various Techniques that allow a skilled Pole user to punish foes that dare enter their reach.
* **Projectile** weapons such as bows and slings are less accurate than their melee counterparts, but make up for it with extremely high damage and range. As long as a spiritbound is able to catch their foes outside of _Cover_, ranged weapons will deal consistently high damage. With investment in the appropriate _Techniques_ most Ranged weapons can also create dangerous _Hazards_ on the battlefield, punishing immobile foes.
* **Thrown** weapons are less a category of weapons and more a subset of other weapons. While less accurate than their melee counterparts, _Thrown_ weapons are incredibly fast and allow for a large number of attacks at flexible ranges at the expense of disarming yourself.
* **Shields** are the least damaging of the weapon types, but enhance a character's ability to _Ward_ attacks. Investing further into shield Disciplines will enhance this capability further and turn a shield-bearer into a mobile fortress capable of defending allies.

Among each of these weapon categories there's a range of different options that provide different tradeoffs between the number of hands they take, their damage, and their speed. Characters may select as many weapons as they wish but must be mindful of the total _Weight_ of their gear. The higher a character's Weight the lower their Movement, and no character may carry more than 16 Weight of equipment.
