### Choosing Your Styles, Stances, and Techniques
In combat, spiritbound make use of their Style, Stance, and various Techniques to control the flow of battle. Styles and Stances are similar; each reflects how the character is expecting to  act in combat, with a Style representing their martial prowess and their Stance representing how they are making use of their spirit's power. Techniques are the Actions and Reactions that characters make use of in combat, and are the core of what happens on a turn.
&nbsp;
To start, select two Styles. It's recommended that you select ones that align with the weapons and armor you selected in a previous step, or ones that are fairly independent of weapon and armor choice, such as the Styles found in the Gladiator Discipline. Regardless, make sure to select Styles that you can actually make use of; if you didn't pick up a Lance or a Two-Handed Weapon, avoid Styles that enhance those playstyles!

Next, select two Stances from those available to the type of spirit that you chose. Each spirit has five Disciplines; two that focus on directly manipulating their element, one that focuses on an emotion, one that focuses on a physical trait, and one that focuses on a sense. In general, the elemental manipulation and emotion Stances are a bit more dependant on spirit Techniques, while the physical and sensory Stances can easily enhance any playstyle. If you want a more spirit-focused playstyle, the former will be the best choices for you, while if you want a more martial playstyle you should focus on the latter. If you're not sure what you want to do, pick something that seems interesting!
&nbsp;
Next, select Techniques. You may select four Techniques from the various Skill Masteries and four Techniques from the Spirit Masteries available to your Spirit. If a Technique has requirements, ensure that you can actually make use of it before selecting it. In general, Techniques will tend to synergize with Stances and Styles from their respective Disciplines, but you can mix and match as you see fit!
&nbsp;
Finally, you may select one additional Stance or Style and two additional Techniques, split between Skill and Spirit Masteries as you wish. Use this to customize your playstyle and focus more on either your spirit or martial aspects!
