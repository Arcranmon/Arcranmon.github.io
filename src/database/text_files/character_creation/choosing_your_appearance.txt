### Choosing Your Appearance
The people of Deskar are extremely diverse due to the nature of the previously shattered civilizations. Most tend towards a more rugged appearance due to the struggles of surviving in the current world, but most have some small 'tell' in their appearance that indicates their spirit type. For most this manifests as a stereotypical hair or eye color, but some have more extreme expressions, such as a vibrant natural tatoo-like scar, stony skin, or hair that always flows as if in the wind.

As important as your spiritbound's appearance is, the appearance of their spirit is just as important. Spirits tend to take the appearance of a small creature, with the general trends outlined earlier in the 'Choosing Your Spirit' section. While they tend towards a specific type of animal, it's not uncommon for spirits' physical forms to be a bit of a hybrid of several different animals. Most spirit's default forms are small enough to comfortably fit on a human's shoulder, although some get as large as a cat or small dog. The physical form of a spirit tends to take cues from the Techniques and Stances their spiritbound most often makes use of. If a spiritbound primarily specializes in the elemental control disciplines, their spirit is often largely comprised of that element. For example, a windbound that specializes in the Storm Discipline might have a spirit whose physical form is largely comprised of lightning. Spiritbound that specialize in the emotional discipline of their spirit tend to have spirits that are a bit more ghostly and ethereal in nature. Finally, spiritbound that specialize in the physical and sensory applications often have spirits that trend closer to an actual animal in appearance, although they still have odd markings or some indication of their elemental alignment.
