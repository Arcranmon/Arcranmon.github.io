### Choosing Your Appearance
The people of Deskar are extremely diverse; due to the tumultus and dangerous state of the world people from wildly different homelands and backgrounds have formed communities together. In addition, most have adopted physical traits that are reminiscent of teir spirit. For most this manifests as a stereotypical hair or eye color, but some have more extreme expressions, such as a glowing tattoo-like scar, stony skin, or hair that always flows as if in the wind. Your character can be anywhere from a standard human to somebody with heavy feline features, vibrant hair that flickers like flames, and eyes like burning coals.

As important as your spiritbound's appearance is, the appearance of their spirit is just as important. Spirits tend to take the appearance of a small creature, with the general trends outlined earlier in the 'Choosing Your Spirit' section. While they tend towards a specific type of animal, it's not uncommon for spirits' physical forms to be a bit of a hybrid of several different animals. Most spirit's default forms are small enough to comfortably fit on a human's shoulder, although some get as large as a cat or small dog.

The physical form of a spirit tends to take cues from the Techniques and Stances their spiritbound most often makes use of. If a spiritbound primarily specializes in the elemental control disciplines, their spirit is often largely comprised of that element. A windbound that specializes in the Storm Discipline might have a spirit whose physical form is largely comprised of lightning. Spiritbound that specialize in the emotional discipline of their spirit tend to have spirits that are a bit more ghostly and ethereal in nature. Finally, spiritbound that specialize in the physical and sensory applications often have spirits that trend closer to an actual animal in appearance, although they still have odd markings or some indication of their elemental alignment.
