### Choosing Your Equipment
The next decision that will define your spiritbound is what equipment they make use of. A bow, shield and spear, and unarmed combat will all play differently.
&nbsp;
The first choice a character must make for their equipment is what armor (if any) they will wear. The heavier an armor is, the more Endurance and Armor a character will have but the more their mobility will be limited, particularly with Actions that only provide a small amount of Movement. Disciplines that focus on the lighter armors tend to emphasize mobility and evasion, while the heavier armors emphasize stability and blocking. A character may choose a single type of armor, ignoring shields for the moment.
&nbsp;
The next choice is the type of weapons that a character will wield. In combat, a character can wield up to two hands worth of weaponry at a time. There are a handful of different weapon types, all with their own perks:
* **Unarmed** weapons simply make use of the spiritbound's body and tend to be very fast and excel for accumulating Momentum are impossible to be disarmed of, creating a consistent playstyle that can rapidly achieve powerful techniques. While low-damage, Unarmed weapons also tend to provide a great number of opportunities to inflict status conditions on foes.
* **Blade** weapons such as swords and daggers tend to be faster, and provide a balanced approach. Most bladed weapons inflict Bleed, which can slowly take down a foe over time. Bladed weapons also tend to have a higher variance in damage than the other types of weapons and can provide the opportunity for massive damage when attacking at Advantage.
* **Blunt** weapons such as hammers and axes tend to be slow but powerful weapons that excel at punching through blocks and armor. They can frequently Expose or Push foes, allowing them to set up powerful combinations with allies. Blunt weapons also tend to have a fairly flat damage profile, making them extremely consistent and making blocks less effective.
* **Chain** weapons such as whips as extremely fast and can attack at great range. While they tend to not do as much damage as the other weapon types, their high speed and ability to Pull enemies or knock them Prone make them a useful tool for both controlling an area and harassing enemies.
* **Lance** weapons such as spears and pikes don't have the same speed and reach as whips but do considerably more damage and boast higher accuracy than other weapon types. Lance weapons tend to Hobble, which limits the mobility of foes, and have various Techniques that allow a skilled Lance user to punish foes that dare enter their reach.
* **Ranged** weapons such as bows and slings are less accurate than their melee counterparts, but make up for it with extremely high damage and range. As long as a spiritbound is able to catch their foes outside of cover, ranged weapons are incredibly powerful. With investment in the appropriate techniques most Ranged weapons can also create dangerous Hazards on the battlefield, punishing immobile foes.
* Finally, **Shields** are the last damaging of the weapon types, but enhance a character's ability to block attacks. Investing further into shield Disciplines will enhance this capability further and turn a shield-bearer into a mobile fortress.

Among each of these weapon categories there's a range of different options that provide different tradeoffs between the number of hands they take, their damage, and their speed. From the various options you may select 4 'hands' worth of items. For example, a Greatsword requires two hands, as does a Longbow, so a spiritbound choosing these two options could carry no other weapons. A spiritbound could instead focus on one-handed weapons and select a Shield, Spear, Longsword, and Hammer. Regardless, once a character has selected their armor and weapons they are done selecting their equipment and may proceed to the next step!

NOTE: This will probably heavily change when exploration rules are added in, simply because Encumbrance will be a thing then.
