### Choosing Your Stances and Styles
A spiritbound's Styles and Stances are similar; each reflects how the character is expecting to  act in combat, with a Style representing their martial prowess and their Stance representing how they are making use of their spirit's power.
&nbsp;
To start, select two Styles. It's recommended that you select ones that align with the weapons and armor you selected in a previous step, or ones that are fairly independent of weapon and armor choice, such as the Styles found in the [Discipline that doesn't exist yet]. Regardless, make sure to select Styles that you can actually make use of; if you didn't pick up a Pole or a Two-Handed Weapon, avoid Styles that enhance those playstyles!

Next, select two Stances from those available to the type of spirit that you chose. Each spirit has five Disciplines; two that focus on directly manipulating their element, one that focuses on an emotion, one that focuses on a physical trait, and one that focuses on a sense. In general, the elemental manipulation and emotion Stances are a bit more dependent on spirit Techniques, while the physical and sensory Stances lean more towards Weapons, although either can enhance any playstyle.
