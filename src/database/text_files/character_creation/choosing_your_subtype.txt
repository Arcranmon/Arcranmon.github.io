### Choosing Your Spirit Subtype
Within each element there exists multiple expressions of said element; a spirit of Earth could focus more on land and soil, solid stone, or the more ephemeral expressions, such as courage. Whatever subtype you pick will impact the physical form that your spirit takes, the starting Spirit abilities you have access to, and the Disciplines that you may initially select from. You can expand to other subtypes of spirit magic over the course of the game, but your initial choices mu match your spirit's subtype.
