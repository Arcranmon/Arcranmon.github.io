Characters are comprised of the following:

Disciplines: A character's combat stats and what they are capable of in battle.
Talents: Magical/mundane abilities that border on superhuman
Skills: End of the list?
Recoveryy/Travel: Increased only by Talents.

BIG QUESTION
    - Do we just carve up all the different Skills into useful subsections? And key Rolls off of them?
    - Would mean that every single skill would need an applicable use in Travel.
    - Could make Knacks a two-tier setup that grants a soft narrative power and a harder travel power.
    - Try to make a Major/Minor split between Skills and have soft groupings of them.
        - Major should be powerful skills/ones constantly used in Travel.
            - Athletics, Awareness, Combat, Medicine, Survival, Rapport, Socialize, Subterfuge, Spirits
        - Minor should be weaker and more situational/only used in Travel through Knacks.
            - Animals, Performance, Cooking/Alchemy?, Mechanics, Knowledge, Languages, Scheme
        - Spirit are special, and ranked up individually with Talents

Non-Combat Resources:
Stamina: Represents a character's ability to deal with wounds, hunger, and sleep deprivation. Depletion is BAD.
Spirit: What powers a lot of a character's Spirit Knacks. Depletion means no Spirit powers.

Grievous injuries can be reflected as individual Conditions.
