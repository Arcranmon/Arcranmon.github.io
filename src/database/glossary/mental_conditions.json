If they do, they clear their topmost Courage Token. A creature may spend Focus at the end of a turn to remove a total value of Courage (not Tokens) equal to one less than the Focus spent. If a creature has any Fear Tokens and would gain a Courage Token, they instead remove their topmost Fear Token."
