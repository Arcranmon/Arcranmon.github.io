## To-Do

- Cooler buttons.
- Potentially add 'Free Movement' (a limited pool of movement characters can use to move further)
- Develop consumable items that characters can choose to take at the start of an expedition and develop some Skill Arts for them.
- Arts to support Weapons/Unarmed, and more weapon types.
- Complete all Spirit Arts.
- Refine Health and Health system based on how long combats should last.
- Expand and refine all Spirit Arts to make sure that each spirit type feels different, as well as the individual disciplines.
  - Once the rest of the system is in a good place, consider adding Light, Dark, and Beast Spirit Arts.
  - Figure out how manifesting a spirit/super moves should work; this will likely come with the Beast Spirit Art as their Spirit will always be manifested by default.
  - Add an additional 'bending' Discipline to each Element:
    - Earth: Dust
    - Flame: Smoke/Ash
    - Metal: ???
    - Water: ???
    - Wind: Sound
    - Wood: Poison
- Develop some basic NPC stat blocks for testing.
  - Make some less basic NPC stat blocks for fun.
  - Develop BIG SPIRIT FIGHTS where simply killing them is the easy answer, but it's possible to instead save them by greatly increasing the difficulty of the fight.
- Make some good player tools. This will probably require some sort of play board so players can easily track conditions and their own Initiative.
- Non-combat gameplay does not currently exist in any meaningful form and needs to be built once the combat system is in a good place.
- Combat abilities are governed by Disciplines
  - Travel abilities are governed by Jobs
  - Narrative abilities are governed by Talents and Knacks
- Create a system for exploration and camping and expeditions that is resource management-lite but rewards players with combat resources.
- Create a 'home base' sort of system that allows for a town or city to develop over time depending on whether players take a more aggressive approach against the spirits or seek healing and peace.
