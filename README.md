## Welcome to the world of Deskar, the land of Shattered Spirits!

For as long as any can remember, humanity and spirits have been as one. They have thrived for generations, forging bonds and conquering obstacles with their shared strength. When the spirits bonded to humanity were not sufficient the ancient primal spirits of the world would assist, pushing aside all obstacles. That is, until the Sundering.

25 years ago something very nearly killed the Great Spirit. While She survived, Her essence was sundered into many parts. Just as She was split, so was every spirit across the land, from the minor spirits bound to humanity to the primal spirits in the deep corners of the world. Spirits that had pacts with local tribes flew into a rage, and disasters wracked the world as the full wrath of the spirits was turned against humanity for the first time. While humanity survived they were scattered and weak, surviving only because they maintained their bonds with lesser spirits.

Prior to the Sundering, spirits were not constrained to a single element and neither were the humans bound to them. Now, spirits possess a fraction of their former strength and can manipulate only a single element. A farmer who could once control water for irrigation, plow their fields with earth and encourage growth for their crops all with a singular spirit is now lucky to have retained a single aspect of this. With the power of spirits shattered across people, communities began to grow more and more swiftly and, with a more narrow set of powers, humanity began to specialize into more and more specific abilities. The dangers of primal spirits still enraged by the Sundering and the division of power between people forced small hamlets to combine and become towns and cities, relying more on one another more than spirits around them.

Now, the world stands on a precipice. The primal spirits of the world are injured, enraged, and far fewer in number than they once were. Some within these new towns and cities would strike them down to ensure their safety and guarantee they are never at the mercy of a spirit again. Others, who remember the old tales, seek to calm the spirits, restore She Of Many Parts, and see if they can heal the world. Regardless of their choice, both parties fear the rumors of new, great beasts who are neither spirit nor human, but surpass either in power and cruelty.

You, and the spirit bound to you, possess great skill and can push this pendulum in either direction. Will you clear a path for humanity in this world and eradicate the threat of the rampaging spirits once and for all, or will you look for a path towards healing and peace, restoring the bond with spirits?

## Gameplay

Shattered Spirits is a tabletop RPG with an emphasis on tactical combat and meaningful choices, both in character design and gameplay. Your character is bound to an elemental spirit, either of Earth, Flame, Metal, Water, Wind, or Wood, that grants them supernatural abilities with a wide range of effects.

Combat is tactical, with an emphasis on terrain, positioning, and resource management. Characters gain Momentum and defensive tokens that they can use to amplify the effects of their abilities or negate a foe's assault, but must fight in a certain way to maximum their potential. Weapons give unique effects and options in battle and the combination of your character's fighting style and spirit gives many options to specialize your character.

Outside of combat, characters will make use of both their skills and those of their spirits in a simplified narrative system that allows a bit more creativity than the hard, tactical systems of combat. How characters interact with spirits within themselves and throughout the world will have a lasting impact on the world and can decide the fate of Deskar forever.

## Inspirations

If it wasn't obvious from the setting pitch, _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ and Jim Butcher's _Codex Alera_ series are significant influences on the power system. There's a healthy dose of playing way too much _Pokemon_ and _Golden Sun_ tossed in there, and any spirit important enough to show up in the story needs to have a _Spirit Island_-esque name.

Mechanically, the biggest influences are _Gloomhaven_, the _Divinity_ series, and _Fire Emblem_. _Gloomhaven_ inspired a lot of the Initiative system as well as my focus on making everything incredibly action-oriented. _Divinity_ helped with the terrain and status focus that I wanted, and _Fire Emblem_, particularly _Three Houses_ was a big inspiration for creating a lot of the more martial abilities within the system.

## To-Do

BEFORE V0.1 (Earth)

- Remake character creator

MISSING TECHNIQUES
These are Techniques/Maneuvers that existed in previous content but are missing in the current Discipline refactor:

- Earthen Agility (new Discipline for moving using Earth?)
- Sinkhole (will be the Tier III Clay Shaper)
- Avalanche Charge (doesn't fit new Boulder Discipline identity, add somewhere later)
- Jaws of the Earth (Tier III Piercing Shard)
- Haft Strike/Spear Vault (new Staff specialty?)
- Impaling Strike (Tier III spear tech)
- Gilgamesh Swing (Tier III Shattering Granite)

This system is very much a work-in-progress, but is slowly getting more and more developed! Future work:

- Add consumable items and support for them.
- Add more combat support for the fiction of it being you and your companion spirit.
  - Have a manifest maneuver to physically conjure your spirit for a turn.
- Support-based non-spirit classes.
- More weapon types and supporting Disciplines.
- Potential Resist refactor?
- Potential shift from armor-based movement to weight profiles.
- Complete all Spirit Masteries.
- Refine Endurance and Health system based on how long combats should last.
- Expand and refine all Spirit Masteries to make sure that each spirit type feels different, as well as the individual disciplines.
  - Once the rest of the system is in a good place, consider adding Light, Dark, and Beast Spirit Masteries.
  - Figure out how manifesting a spirit/super moves should work; this will likely come with the Beast Spirit Mastery as their Spirit will always be manifested by default.
  - Add an additional 'bending' Discipline to each Element:
    - Earth: Dust
    - Flame: Heat
    - Metal: ???
    - Water: ???
    - Wind: Sound
    - Wood: Poison
- Balance pass over Weapons and Stances to make sure they are competitive with Spirit options.
- Develop consumable items that characters can choose to take at the start of an expedition and develop some Skill Masteries for them.
- Develop some basic NPC stat blocks for testing.
  - Make some less basic NPC stat blocks for fun.
  - Develop BIG SPIRIT FIGHTS where simply killing them is the easy answer, but it's possible to instead save them by greatly increasing the difficulty of the fight.
- Make some good player tools. This will probably require some sort of play board so players can easily track conditions and their own Initiative.
- Non-combat gameplay does not currently exist in any meaningful form and needs to be built once the combat system is in a good place.
- Combat abilities are governed by Disciplines
  - Travel abilities are governed by Jobs
  - Narrative abilities are governed by Talents and Knacks
- Create a system for exploration and camping and expeditions that is resource management-lite but rewards players with combat resources.
- Create a 'home base' sort of system that allows for a town or city to develop over time depending on whether players take a more aggressive approach against the spirits or seek healing and peace.
