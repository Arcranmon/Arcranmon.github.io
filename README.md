# Welcome to the world of Deskar, the land of Shattered Spirits!

For much of its history, the spirits and people of Deskar have lived together in harmony, forging bonds and thriving with their shared strength, with great spirits of the natural world helping where smaller Bound spirits could not. This peace, however, was not to last. 25 years ago the Sundering occured when something or someone harmed the Great Spirit. While she survived, her essence was sundered into many parts, an effect that cascaded across nearly all the spirits of the world. Spirits that had pacts with local tribes flew into a rage, and disasters wracked the world as the spirits fury was unleashed.

In the past, all spirits could make use of all elements and, by extension, all Spiritbound could do the same. Now, spirits are a fraction of their former strength and represent only a single element. A farmer who could once control water for irrigation, plow their fields with earth and encourage growth for their crops all with a singular spirit is now lucky to have retained a single aspect of this. With the power of spirits shattered across people, communities began to grow more and more swiftly and, with a more narrow set of powers, Spiritbound began to specialize into more and more specific abilities. With the dangers of spirits still enraged and volatile from the Sundering and need for more Spiritbound to complete simple tasks small hamlets have become towns and cities, relying more on one another than spirits around them.

Now, the world stands on a precipice. The great spirits of the world are injured, enraged, and far fewer in number than they once were., Some within these new towns and cities would strike them down to ensure their safety moving forward and gaurantee they are never at the mercy of a spirt again. Others, who remember the old tales, seek to calm the spirits, restore the She Of Many Parts, and see if they can heal the world. Regardless of their choice, both party fear the rumors of new, great beasts who are neither spirit nor human, but greatly surpass either in power.

You are a Spiritbound with great skill, in magics and otherwise and can push this pendulum in either direction . Will you clear a path for humanity in this world and eradicate the threat of the rampaging spirits once and for all, or will you look for a path towards healing and peace, restoring the friendship that once was there?

## Gameplay

Shattered Spirits is a tabletop RPG with an emphasis on tactical combat and meaningful choices, both in character design and gameplay. Your character is bound to an elemental spirit, either of Earth, Flame, Metal, Water, Wind, or Wood, that grants them supernatural abilities with a wide range of effects.

Combat is tactical, with an emphasis on terrain, positioning, and resource management. Characters gain Momentum and defensive tokens that they can use to amplify the effects of their abilities or negate a foe's assault, but must fight in a certain way to maximum their potential. Weapons give unique effects and options in battle and the combination of your character's fighting style and spirit gives many options to specialize your character.

Outside of combat, characters will make use of both their skills and those of their spirits in a simplified narrative system that allows a bit more creative than the hard, tactical systems of combat. How characters interact with spirits within and without will have a lasting impact on the world and can decide the fate of Deskar forever.

## To-Do

- This system is very much a work-in-progress, but is slowly getting more and more developed!
- Do some math and figure out how much Endurance and Health that each character should have based on how long combats should last.
  - Once this math is figured out, create statblocks for the various Obstacles.
- Expand and refine all Spirit Masteries to make sure that each spirit type feels different, as well as the individual disciplines.
  - Earth almost definitely needs a balance pass simply because it was completed first and they're likely undertuned now.
  - Add more comprehensive descriptions for how each discipline plays and what their strengths and weaknesses are.
  - Once the rest of the system is in a good place, consider adding Light, Dark, and Beast Spirit Masteries.
- Styles are very underdeveloped compared to Spirits at the moment and need to be expanded to include a wider range of fighting styles and options.
- Balance pass over Weapons and Styles to make sure they are competitive with Spirit options.
- Develop consumable items that characters can choose to take at the start of an expedition and develop some Skill Masteries for them.
- Develop some basic NPC stat blocks for testing.
  - Make some less basic NPC stat blocks for fun.
  - Develop BIG SPIRIT FIGHTS where simply killing them is the easy answer, but it's possible to instead heal them by greatly increasing the difficulty of the fight.
- Non-combat gameplay does not currently exist in any meaningful form and needs to be built once the combat system is in a good place.
- Create a system for exploration and camping and expeditions that is resource management-lite but rewards players with combat resources.
- Create a 'home base' sort of system that allows for a town or city to develop over time depending on whether players take a more aggressive approach against the spirits or seek healing and peace.
